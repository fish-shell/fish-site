# Contributing Guidelines

You can edit the main page, the tutorial, the 404 page, and assets (e.g. CSS, JS, images) from this repo,
they're all in [`site/`](site).

If you're making changes to the documentation, FAQ, design document, or something similar, don't edit [`docs/`](site/docs/).  
Instead, fork the fish-shell repo and make the changes in [`doc_src/`](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/master/doc_src/).
The raw source of the documentation lies there.
