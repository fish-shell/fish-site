# fish-shell Trademarks

The **fish-shell** name and fish logos (collectively, "fish trademarks") are trademarks (registered or unregistered) owned by the fish-shell project.

## When you can use fish-shell trademarks without asking permission

You may use fish trademarks without asking permission:

- To describe or reference fish-shell, such as in blog posts or documentation
- In a way that qualifies as "nominative fair use", i.e. referring to fish-shell without implying sponsorship or endorsement
- Creating non-commercial merchandise (stickers, wallpapers, etc.)
- Creating commercial merchandise if you clearly distinguish your product from fish-shell itself

## Prohibited Use (requires permission)

You must **not** use fish trademarks in a way that:

- Falsely implies endorsement, affiliation, or sponsorship by fish-shell
- Names your product/service "fish-shell" (or confusingly close)
- Suggests that your version is the "official" fish shell or is part of the project
