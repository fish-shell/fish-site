        "body": "This release of fish fixes a number of issues identified in fish 4.0.2:\r\n\r\n- fish now properly inherits $PATH under Windows WSL2 ([#11354](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11354)).\r\n- Remote filesystems are detected properly again on non-Linux systems.\r\n- the [printf](https://fishshell.com/docs/4.0/cmds/printf.html) builtin no longer miscalculates width of multi-byte characters ([#11412](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11412)).\r\n- For many years, fish has been \u201crelocatable\u201d -- it was possible to move the entire `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` and fish would use paths relative to its binary.\r\n  Only gettext locale paths were still determined purely at compile time, which has been fixed.\r\n- the [commandline](https://fishshell.com/docs/4.0/cmds/commandline.html) builtin failed to print the commandline set by a `commandline -C` invocation, which broke some completion scripts.\r\n  This has been corrected ([#11423](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11423)).\r\n- To work around terminals that fail to parse Operating System Command (OSC) sequences, a temporary feature flag has been added.\r\n  It allows you to disable prompt marking (OSC 133) by running (once) `set -Ua fish_features no-mark-prompt` and restarting fish ([#11749](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11749)).\r\n- The routines to save history and universal variables have seen some robustness improvements.\r\n- builtin [status current-command](https://fishshell.com/docs/4.0/cmds/status.html) no longer prints a trailing blank line.\r\n- A crash displaying multi-line quoted command substitutions has been fixed ([#11444](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11444)).\r\n- Commands like `set fish_complete_path ...` accidentally disabled completion autoloading, which has been corrected.\r\n- `nmcli` completions have been fixed to query network information dynamically instead of only when completing the first time.\r\n- Git completions no longer print an error when no git-foo executable is in `$PATH`.\r\n- Custom completions like `complete foo -l long -xa ...` that use the output of `commandline -t`.\r\n  on a command-line like `foo --long=` have been invalidated by a change in 4.0; the completion scripts have been adjusted accordingly ([#11508](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11508)).\r\n- Some completions were misinterpreted, which caused garbage to be displayed in the completion list. This has been fixed.\r\n- fish no longer interprets invalid control sequences from the terminal as if they were `alt-[` or `alt-o` key strokes.\r\n- [bind](https://fishshell.com/docs/4.0/cmds/bind.html) has been taught about the `printscreen` and `menu` keys.\r\n- `alt-delete` now deletes the word right of the cursor.\r\n- `ctrl-alt-h` erases the last word again ([#11548](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11548)).\r\n- `alt-left` `alt-right` were misinterpreted because they send unexpected sequences on some terminals; a workaround has been added.  ([#11479](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11479)).\r\n- Key bindings like `bind shift-A` are no longer accepted; use `bind shift-a` or `bind A`.\r\n- Key bindings like `bind shift-a` take precedence over `bind A` when the key event included the shift modifier.\r\n- Bindings using shift with non-ASCII letters (such as `ctrl-shift-\u00e4`) are now supported.\r\n- Bindings with modifiers such as `bind ctrl-w` work again on non-Latin keyboard layouts such as a Russian one.\r\n  This is implemented by allowing key events such as `ctrl-\u0446` to match bindings of the corresponding Latin key, using the kitty keyboard protocol\u2019s base layout key ([#11520](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11520)).\r\n- Vi mode: The cursor position after pasting via `p` has been corrected.\r\n- Vi mode: Trying to replace the last character via `r` no longer replaces the last-but-one character ([#11484](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11484)),\r\n----\r\n\r\n*Download links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-4.0.6.tar.xz\". The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" will not build correctly.*\r\n\r\n*There is no GPG signature because we haven't yet decided how to integrate signing into the new release automation.*\r\n\r\n*macOS packages will [be uploaded shortly](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/actions/runs/17670935506/job/50222609783).*\r\n\r\n*The files called fish-4.0.6-linux-\\*.tar.xz are experimental packages containing a single standalone fish binary for any Linux with the given architecture.*\r\n",

        "body": "This release of fish fixes a number of issues identified in fish 4.0.1:\r\n\r\n- Completions are quoted, rather than backslash-escaped, only if the completion is unambiguous. Continuing to edit the token is therefore easier ([#11271](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11271)). This changes the behavior introduced in 4.0.0 where all completions were quoted.\r\n- The warning when the terminfo database can\u2019t be found has been downgraded to a log message. fish will act as if the terminal behaves like xterm-256color, which is correct for the vast majority of cases ([#11277](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11277), [#11290](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11290)).\r\n- Key combinations using the super (Windows/command) key can now (actually) be bound using the `super-` prefix ([#11217](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11217)). This was listed in the release notes for 4.0.1 but did not work correctly.\r\n- [function](cmds/function.md) is stricter about argument parsing, rather than allowing additional parameters to be silently ignored ([#11295](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11295)).\r\n- Using parentheses in the [test](cmds/test.md) builtin works correctly, following a regression in 4.0.0 where they were not recognized ([#11387](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11387)).\r\n- `delete` in Vi mode when Num Lock is active will work correctly ([#11303](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11303)).\r\n- Abbreviations cannot alter the command-line contents, preventing a crash ([#11324](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11324)).\r\n- Improvements to various completions, including new completions for `wl-randr` ([#11301](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11301)), performance improvements for `cargo` completions by avoiding network requests ([#11347](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11347)), and other improvements for  `btrfs` ([#11320](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11320)), `cryptsetup` ([#11315](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11315)), `git` ([#11319](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11319), [#11322](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11322), [#11323](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11323)), `jj` ([#11046](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11046)), and `systemd-analyze` ([#11314](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11314)).\r\n- The Mercurial (`hg`) prompt can handle working directories that contain an embedded newline, rather than producing errors ([#11348](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11348)).\r\n- A number of crashes have been fixed. Triggers include prompts containing backspace characters ([#11280](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11280)), history pager search ([#11355](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11355)), invalid UTF-8 in [read](cmds/read.md) ([#11383](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11383)), and the `kill-selection` binding ([#11367](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11367)).\r\n- A race condition in the test suite has been fixed ([#11254](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11254)), and a test for fish versioning relaxed to support downstream distributors\u2019 modifications ([#11173](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11173)).\r\n- Small improvements to the documentation ([#11264](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11264), [#11329](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11329), [#11361](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11361)).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n*Download links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-4.0.2.tar.xz\". The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" will not build correctly. The SHA-256 sum of this file is `6e1ecdb164285fc057b2f35acbdc20815c1623099e7bb47bbfc011120adf7e83`. A GPG signature from David Adam (key ID `0x7A67D962D88A709A` is available as \"fish-4.0.2.tar.xz.asc\".*\r\n\r\n*The files called fish-static-\\* are experimental, statically linked builds, for any Linux with the given architecture. Extract and run, and they will extract their data files as needed.*",

        "body": "This release of fish includes the following improvements compared to fish 4.0.0:\r\n\r\n- Key combinations using the super (Windows/command) key can be bound using the `super-` prefix ([#11217](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11217)).\r\n- Konsole\u2019s menu shows the \u201cOpen folder with\u201d option again ([#11198](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11198)).\r\n- `$fish_color_search_match` will now only be applied to the foreground color if it has an explicit foreground. For example, this allows setting:\r\n  `set -g fish_color_search_match --reverse`\r\n- Cursor shape commands (`\\e[2 q`) are no longer sent in non-interactive shells or in redirections ([#11255](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11255)).\r\n- [status](cmds/status.md) gained a `is-interactive-read` subcommand, to check whether the script is being called from an interactive [read](cmds/read.md) invocation.\r\n- fish\u2019s background tasks are now started in a way that avoids an error on macOS Terminal.app ([#11181](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11181)).\r\n- Using key combinations within qemu should work correctly.\r\n- Prompts containing control characters no longer cause incorrect display of command lines ([#11252](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11252)).\r\n- Cancelling the command-line in Vi mode displays correctly again ([#11261](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11261)).\r\n- The acidhub prompt properly displays the git branch again ([#11179](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11179)).\r\n- Completions for `wine` correctly include files again ([#11202](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11202)).\r\n- On macOS, paths from `/etc/paths` and `/etc/manpaths` containing colons are handled correctly ([#10684](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10684)). This functionality was included in the 4.0.0 release notes but was missing from the source code.\r\n- The XTerm `modifyOtherKeys` keyboard encoding is no longer used under WezTerm, as it does not work correctly in all layouts ([#11204](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11204)).\r\n- `option-left` and other similar keys should now work in iTerm versions before 3.5.12; the kitty keyboard protocol is now disabled on these versions ([#11192](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11192)).\r\n- The kitty keyboard protocol is no longer used under Midnight Commander, as it does not work correctly ([#10640](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10640)).\r\n- fish now sends the commandline along with the OSC 133 semantic prompt command start sequence. This fixes a test in the kitty terminal ([#11203](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11203)).\r\n- Git completions for third-party commands like \u201cgit-absorb\u201d are completed correctly again ([#11205](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11205)).\r\n- Completions for `diskutil` no longer produce an error ([#11201](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11201)).\r\n- The output of certain error messages no longer prints newlines to standard output ([#11248](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11248)).\r\n- A number of crashes have been fixed, including file names longer than 255 bytes ([#11221](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11221)), using fish on a btrfs filesystem ([#11219](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11219)), history files that do not have the expected format ([#11236](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11236)), and pasting into an empty command line ([#11256](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11256)).\r\n\r\n*Download links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-4.0.1.tar.xz\". The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" will not build correctly. The SHA-256 sum of this file is `4ed63a70207283e15cf21fc5f21db4230421e4f98d4826b5b1c8254d69c762b5`. A GPG signature from David Adam (key ID `0x7A67D962D88A709A` is available as \"fish-4.0.1.tar.xz.asc\".*\r\n\r\n*The files called fish-static-\\* are experimental, statically linked builds, for any Linux with the given architecture. Extract and run, and they will extract their data files as needed.*\r\n",

Packagers should see the [For Distributors](#rust-packaging) section at the end.\r\n\r\n### Notable backwards-incompatible changes\r\n\r\n- As part of a larger binding rework, `bind` gained a new key notation.\r\n  In most cases the old notation should keep working, but in rare cases you may have to change a `bind` invocation to use the new notation.\r\n  See [below](#changelog-new-bindings) for details.\r\n- `ctrl-c` now calls a new bind function called `clear-commandline`. The old behavior, which leaves a \u201c^C\u201d marker, is available as `cancel-commandline` ([#10935](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10935))\r\n- `random` will produce different values from previous versions of fish when used with the same seed, and will work more sensibly with small seed numbers.\r\n  The seed was never guaranteed to give the same result across systems,\r\n  so we do not expect this to have a large impact ([#9593](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9593)).\r\n- Variables in command position that expand to a subcommand keyword are now forbidden to fix a likely user error.\r\n  For example, `set editor command emacs; $editor` is no longer allowed ([#10249](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10249)).\r\n- `functions --handlers` will now list handlers in a different order.\r\n  Now it is definition order, first to last, where before it was last to first.\r\n  This was never specifically defined, and we recommend not relying on a specific order ([#9944](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9944)).\r\n- The `qmark-noglob` feature, introduced in fish 3.0, is enabled by default. That means `?` will no longer act as a single-character glob.\r\n  You can, for the time being, turn it back on by adding `no-qmark-noglob` to `fish_features` and restarting fish:\r\n  ```fish-docs-samples\r\n  set -Ua fish_features no-qmark-noglob\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  The flag will eventually be made read-only, making it impossible to turn off.\r\n- Terminals that fail to ignore unrecognized OSC or CSI sequences may display garbage. We know cool-retro-term and emacs\u2019 ansi-term are affected, but most mainstream terminals are not.\r\n- fish no longer searches directories from the Windows system/user `$PATH` environment variable for Linux executables. To execute Linux binaries by name (i.e. not with a relative or absolute path) from a Windows folder, make sure the `/mnt/c/...` path is explicitly added to `$fish_user_paths` and not just automatically appended to `$PATH` by `wsl.exe` ([#10506](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10506)).\r\n- Under Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux 1 (not WSL 2), backgrounded jobs that have not been disowned and do not terminate on their own after a `SIGHUP` + `SIGCONT` sequence will be explicitly killed by fish on exit (after the usual prompt to close or disown them) to work around a WSL 1 deficiency that sees backgrounded processes that run into `SIGTTOU` remain in a suspended state indefinitely ([#5263](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5263)). The workaround is to explicitly `disown` processes you wish to outlive the shell session.\r\n\r\n### Notable improvements and fixes\r\n\r\n<a id=\"changelog-new-bindings\"></a>\r\n- fish now requests XTerm\u2019s `modifyOtherKeys` keyboard encoding and [kitty keyboard protocol\u2019s](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/) progressive enhancements ([#10359](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10359)).\r\n  Depending on terminal support, this allows to binding more key combinations, including arbitrary combinations of modifiers `ctrl`, `alt` and `shift`, and distinguishing (for example) `ctrl-i` from `tab`.\r\n\r\n  Additionally, `bind` now supports a human-readable syntax in addition to byte sequences.\r\n  This includes modifier names, and names for keys like `enter` and `backspace`.\r\n  For example\r\n  - `bind up 'do something'` binds the up-arrow key instead of a two-key sequence (\u201cu\u201d and then \u201cp\u201d)\r\n  - `bind ctrl-x,alt-c 'do something'` binds a sequence of two keys.\r\n\r\n  Any key argument that starts with an ASCII control character (like `\\e` or `\\cX`) or is up to 3 characters long, not a named key, and does not contain `,` or `-` will be interpreted in the old syntax to keep compatibility for the majority of bindings.\r\n\r\n  Keyboard protocols can be turned off by disabling the \u201ckeyboard-protocols\u201d feature flag:\r\n  ```fish-docs-samples\r\n  set -Ua fish_features no-keyboard-protocols\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  This is a temporary measure to work around buggy terminals ([#11056](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11056)), which appear to be relatively rare.\r\n  Use this if something like \u201c=0\u201d or \u201c=5u\u201d appears in your commandline mysteriously.\r\n- fish can now be built as a self-installing binary ([#10367](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10367)). That means it can be easily built on one system and copied to another, where it can extract supporting files.\r\n  To do this, run:\r\n  ```fish-docs-samples\r\n  cargo install --path . # in a clone of the fish repository\r\n  # or `cargo build --release` and copy target/release/fish{,_indent,_key_reader} wherever you want\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  The first time it runs interactively, it will extract all the data files to  `~/.local/share/fish/install/`. A specific path can be used for the data files with `fish --install=PATH` To uninstall, remove the fish binaries and that directory.\r\n\r\n  This build system is experimental; the main build system, using `cmake`, remains the recommended approach for packaging and installation to a prefix.\r\n- A new function `fish_should_add_to_history` can be overridden to decide whether a command should be added to the history ([#10302](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10302)).\r\n- Bindings can now mix special input functions and shell commands, so `bind ctrl-g expand-abbr \"commandline -i \\n\"` works as expected ([#8186](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8186)).\r\n- Special input functions run from bindings via `commandline -f` are now applied immediately, instead of after the currently executing binding ([#3031](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3031), [#10126](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10126)).\r\n  For example, `commandline -i foo; commandline | grep foo` succeeds now.\r\n- Undo history is no longer truncated after every command, but kept for the lifetime of the shell process.\r\n- The `ctrl-r` history search now uses glob syntax ([#10131](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10131)).\r\n- The `ctrl-r` history search now operates only on the line or command substitution at cursor, making it easier to combine commands from history ([#9751](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9751)).\r\n- Abbreviations can now be restricted to specific commands. For instance:\r\n  ```fish-docs-samples\r\n  abbr --add --command git back 'reset --hard HEAD^'\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  will expand \u201cback\u201d to `reset --hard HEAD^`, but only when the command is `git` ([#9411](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9411)).\r\n\r\n### Deprecations and removed features\r\n\r\n- `commandline --tokenize` (short option `-o`) has been deprecated in favor of `commandline --tokens-expanded` (short option `-x`) which expands variables and other shell syntax, removing the need to use [eval](cmds/eval.md) in completion scripts ([#10212](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10212)).\r\n- Two new feature flags:\r\n  - `remove-percent-self` (see `status features`) disables PID expansion of `%self`, which has been supplanted by `$fish_pid` ([#10262](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10262)).\r\n  - `test-require-arg` disables `test`\u2019s one-argument mode. That means `test -n` without an additional argument will return false, `test -z` will keep returning true. Any other option without an argument, anything that is not an option and no argument will be an error. This also goes for `[`, test\u2019s alternate name.\r\n    This is a frequent source of confusion and so we are breaking with POSIX explicitly in this regard.\r\n    In addition to the feature flag, there is a debug category \u201cdeprecated-test\u201d. Running fish with `fish -d deprecated-test` will show warnings whenever a `test` invocation that would change is used. ([#10365](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10365)).\r\n\r\n  These can be enabled with:\r\n  ```fish-docs-samples\r\n  set -Ua fish_features remove-percent-self test-require-arg\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  We intend to enable them by default in future, and after that eventually make them read-only.\r\n- Specifying key names as terminfo names (using the `bind -k` syntax) is deprecated and may be removed in a future version.\r\n- When a terminal pastes text into fish using bracketed paste, fish used to switch to a special `paste` bind mode.\r\n  This bind mode has been removed. The behavior on paste is no longer configurable.\r\n- When an interactive fish is stopped or terminated by a signal that cannot be caught (SIGSTOP or SIGKILL), it may leave the terminal in a state where keypresses with modifiers are sent as CSI u sequences, instead of traditional control characters or escape sequences that are recognized by Readline and compatible programs, such as bash and python.\r\n  If this happens, you can use the `reset` command from `ncurses` to restore the terminal state.\r\n- `fish_key_reader --verbose` no longer shows timing information.\r\n- Terminal information is no longer read from hashed terminfo databases, or termcap databases ([#10269](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10269)). The vast majority of systems use a non-hashed terminfo database, which is still supported.\r\n- `source` returns an error if used without a filename or pipe/redirection ([#10774](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10774)).\r\n\r\n### Scripting improvements\r\n\r\n- `for` loops will no longer remember local variables from the previous iteration ([#10525](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10525)).\r\n- A new `history append` subcommand appends a command to the history, without executing it ([#4506](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4506)).\r\n- A new redirection: `<? /path/to/file` will try opening the file as input, and if it doesn\u2019t succeed silently uses `/dev/null` instead.\r\n  This can help with checks like `test -f /path/to/file; and string replace foo bar < /path/to/file`. ([#10387](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10387))\r\n- A new option `commandline --tokens-raw` prints a list of tokens without any unescaping ([#10212](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10212)).\r\n- A new option `commandline --showing-suggestion` tests whether an autosuggestion is currently displayed ([#10586](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10586)).\r\n- `functions` and `type` now show that a function was copied and its source, rather than solely `Defined interactively` ([#6575](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6575)).\r\n- Stack trace now shows line numbers for copied functions ([#6575](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6575)).\r\n- `foo & && bar` is now a syntax error, like in other shells ([#9911](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9911)).\r\n- `if -e foo; end` now prints a more accurate error ([#10000](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10000)).\r\n- `cd` into a directory that is not readable but accessible (permissions `--x`) is now possible ([#10432](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10432)).\r\n- An integer overflow in `string repeat` leading to a near-infinite loop has been fixed ([#9899](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9899)).\r\n- `string shorten` behaves better in the presence of non-printable characters, including fixing an integer overflow that shortened strings more than intended ([#9854](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9854)).\r\n- `string pad` no longer allows non-printable characters as padding ([#9854](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9854)).\r\n- `string repeat` now allows omission of `-n` when the first argument is an integer ([#10282](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10282)).\r\n- `string match` and `replace` have a new `--max-matches` option to return as soon as the specified number of matches have been identified, which can improve performance in scripts ([#10587](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10587)).\r\n- `functions --handlers-type caller-exit` once again lists functions defined as `function --on-job-exit caller`, rather than them being listed by `functions --handlers-type process-exit`.\r\n- A new `set --no-event` option sets or erases variables without triggering a variable event. This can be useful to change a variable in an event handler ([#10480](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10480)).\r\n- Commas in command substitution output are no longer used as separators in brace expansion, preventing a surprising expansion in some cases ([#5048](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5048)).\r\n- Universal variables can now store strings containing invalid UTF-8 ([#10313](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10313)).\r\n- A new `path basename -E` option that causes it to return the basename (\u201cfilename\u201d with the directory prefix removed) with the final extension (if any) also removed. This is a shorter version of `path change-extension \"\" (path basename $foo)` ([#10521](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10521)).\r\n- A new `math --scale-mode` option to select `truncate`, `round`, `floor`, `ceiling` as you wish; the default value is `truncate`. ([#9117](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9117)).\r\n- `random` is now less strict about its arguments, allowing a start larger or equal to the end. ([#10879](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10879))\r\n- `function --argument-names` now produces an error if a read-only variable name is used, rather than simply ignoring it ([#10842](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10842)).\r\n- Tilde expansion in braces (that is, `{~,}`) works correctly ([#10610](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10610)).\r\n\r\n### Interactive improvements\r\n\r\n- Autosuggestions were sometimes not shown after recalling a line from history, which has been fixed ([#10287](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10287)).\r\n- Up-arrow search matches -- which are highlighted in reverse colors -- are no longer syntax-highlighted, to fix bad contrast with the search match highlighting.\r\n- Command abbreviations (those with `--position command` or without a `--position`) now also expand after decorators like `command` ([#10396](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10396)).\r\n- Abbreviations now expand after process separators like `;` and `|`. This fixes a regression in version 3.6 ([#9730](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9730)).\r\n- When exporting interactively defined functions (using `type`, `functions` or `funcsave`) the function body is now indented, to match the interactive command line editor ([#8603](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8603)).\r\n- `ctrl-x` (`fish_clipboard_copy`) on multiline commands now includes indentation ([#10437](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10437)).\r\n- `ctrl-v` (`fish_clipboard_paste`) now strips ASCII control characters from the pasted text.\r\n  This is consistent with normal keyboard input ([#5274](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5274)).\r\n- When a command like `fg %2` fails to find the given job, it no longer behaves as if no job spec was given ([#9835](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9835)).\r\n- Redirection in command position like `>echo` is now highlighted as error ([#8877](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8877)).\r\n- `fish_vi_cursor` now works properly inside the prompt created by builtin `read` ([#10088](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10088)).\r\n- fish no longer fails to open a FIFO if interrupted by a terminal resize signal ([#10250](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10250)).\r\n- `read --help` and friends no longer ignore redirections. This fixes a regression in version 3.1 ([#10274](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10274)).\r\n- Measuring a command with `time` now considers the time taken for command substitution ([#9100](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9100)).\r\n- `fish_add_path` now automatically enables verbose mode when used interactively (in the command line), in an effort to be clearer about what it does ([#10532](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10532)).\r\n- fish no longer adopts TTY modes of failed commands ([#10603](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10603)).\r\n- `complete -e cmd` now prevents autoloading completions for `cmd` ([#6716](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6716)).\r\n- fish\u2019s default color scheme no longer uses the color \u201cblue\u201d, as it has bad contrast against the background in a few terminal\u2019s default palettes ([#10758](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10758), [#10786](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10786))\r\n  The color scheme will not be upgraded for existing installs. If you want, you should select it again via `fish_config`.\r\n- Command lines which are larger than the terminal are now displayed correctly, instead of multiple blank lines being displayed ([#7296](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7296)).\r\n- Prompts that use external commands will no longer produce an infinite loop if the command crashes ([#9796](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9796)).\r\n- The output of `jobs` shows \u201c-\u201d for jobs that have the same process group ID as the fish process, rather than \u201c-2\u201d ([#10833](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10833)).\r\n- Job expansion (`%1` syntax) works properly for jobs that are a mixture of external commands and functions ([#10832](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10832)).\r\n- Command lines which have more lines than the terminal can be displayed and edited correctly ([#10827](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10827)).\r\n- Functions that have been erased are no longer highlighted as valid commands ([#10866](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10866)).\r\n- `not`, `time`, and variable assignments (that is `not time a=b env`) is correctly recognized as valid syntax ([#10890](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10890)).\r\n- The Web-based configuration removes old right-hand-side prompts again, fixing a regression in fish 3.4.0 ([#10675](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10675)).\r\n- Further protection against programs which crash and leave the terminal in an inconsistent state ([#10834](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10834), [#11038](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11038)).\r\n- A workaround for git being very slow on macOS has been applied, improving performance after a fresh boot ([#10535](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10535)).\r\n\r\n#### New or improved bindings\r\n\r\n- When the cursor is on a command that resolves to an executable script, `alt-o` will now open that script in your editor ([#10266](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10266)).\r\n- During up-arrow history search, `shift-delete` will delete the current search item and move to the next older item. Previously this was only supported in the history pager.\r\n- `shift-delete` will also remove the currently-displayed autosuggestion from history, and remove it as a suggestion.\r\n- `ctrl-Z` (also known as `ctrl-shift-z`) is now bound to redo.\r\n- Some improvements to the `alt-e` binding which edits the command line in an external editor:\r\n  - The editor\u2019s cursor position is copied back to fish. This is currently supported for Vim and Kakoune.\r\n  - Cursor position synchronization is only supported for a set of known editors, which are now also detected in aliases which use `complete --wraps`. For example, use `complete --wraps my-vim vim` to synchronize cursors when `EDITOR=my-vim`.\r\n  - Multiline commands are indented before being sent to the editor, which matches how they are displayed in fish.\r\n- The `...-path-component` bindings, like `backward-kill-path-component`, now treat `#` as part of a path component ([#10271](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10271)).\r\n- Bindings like `alt-l` that print output in between prompts now work correctly with multiline commandlines.\r\n- `alt-d` on an empty command line lists the directory history again. This restores the behavior of version 2.1.\r\n- `history-prefix-search-backward` and `-forward` now maintain the cursor position, instead of moving the cursor to the end of the command line ([#10430](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10430)).\r\n- The following keys have refined behavior if the terminal supports [the new keyboard encodings](#changelog-new-bindings):\r\n  - `shift-enter` now inserts a newline instead of executing the command line.\r\n  - `ctrl-backspace` now deletes the last word instead of only one character ([#10741](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10741)).\r\n  - `ctrl-delete` deletes the next word (same as `alt-d`).\r\n- New special input functions:\r\n  - `forward-char-passive` and `backward-char-passive` are like their non-passive variants but do not accept autosuggestions or move focus in the completion pager ([#10398](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10398)).\r\n  - `forward-token`, `backward-token`, `kill-token`, and `backward-kill-token` are similar to the `*-bigword` variants but for the whole argument token (which includes escaped spaces) ([#2014](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2014)).\r\n  - `clear-commandline`, which merely clears the command line, as an alternative to `cancel-commandline` which prints `^C` and a new prompt ([#10213](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10213)).\r\n- The `accept-autosuggestion` special input function now returns false when there was nothing to accept ([#10608](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10608)).\r\n- Vi mode has seen some improvements but continues to suffer from the lack of people working on it.\r\n  - New default cursor shapes for insert and replace mode.\r\n  - `ctrl-n` in insert mode accepts autosuggestions ([#10339](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10339)).\r\n  - Outside insert mode, the cursor will no longer be placed beyond the last character on the commandline.\r\n  - When the cursor is at the end of the commandline, a single `l` will accept an autosuggestion ([#10286](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10286)).\r\n  - The cursor position after pasting (`p`) has been corrected.\r\n  - Added an additional binding, `_`, for moving to the beginning of the line ([#10720](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10720)).\r\n  - When the cursor is at the start of a line, escaping from insert mode no longer moves the cursor to the previous line.\r\n  - Added bindings for clipboard interaction, like `\",+,p` and `\",+,y,y`.\r\n  - Deleting in visual mode now moves the cursor back, matching vi ([#10394](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10394)).\r\n  - The `;`, `,`, `v`, `V`, `I`, and `gU` bindings work in visual mode ([#10601](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10601), [#10648](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10648)).\r\n  - Support `%` motion ([#10593](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10593)).\r\n  - `ctrl-k` to remove the contents of the line beyond the cursor in all modes ([#10648](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10648)).\r\n  - Support ab and ib vi text objects. New input functions are introduced `jump-{to,till}-matching-bracket` ([#1842](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1842)).\r\n  - The `E` binding now correctly handles the last character of the word, by jumping to the next word ([#9700](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9700)).\r\n\r\n#### Completions\r\n\r\n- Command-specific tab completions may now offer results whose first character is a period. For example, it is now possible to tab-complete `git add` for files with leading periods. The default file completions hide these files, unless the token itself has a leading period ([#3707](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3707)).\r\n- Option completion now uses fuzzy subsequence filtering, just like non-option completion ([#830](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/830)).\r\n  This means that `--fb` may be completed to `--foobar` if there is no better match.\r\n- Completions that insert an entire token now use quotes instead of backslashes to escape special characters ([#5433](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5433)).\r\n- Normally, file name completions start after the last `:`  or `=` in a token.\r\n  This helps commands like `rsync --files-from=`.\r\n  This special meaning can now disabled by escaping these separators as `\\:` and `\\=`.\r\n  This matches Bash\u2019s behavior.\r\n  Note that this escaping is usually not necessary since the completion engine already tries\r\n  to guess whether the separator is actually part of a file name.\r\n- Various new completion scripts and numerous updates to existing ones.\r\n- Completions could hang if the `PAGER` environment variable was sent to certain editors on macOS, FreeBSD and some other platforms. This has been fixed ([#10820](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10820)).\r\n- Generated completions are now stored in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/fish` or `~/.cache/fish` by default ([#10369](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10369))\r\n- A regression in fish 3.1, where completing a command line could change it completely, has been fixed ([#10904](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10904)).\r\n\r\n#### Improved terminal support\r\n\r\n- fish now marks the prompt and command-output regions (via OSC 133) to enable terminal shell integration ([#10352](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10352)).\r\n  Shell integration shortcuts can scroll to the next/previous prompt or show the last command output in a pager.\r\n- fish now reports the working directory (via OSC 7) unconditionally instead of only for some terminals ([#9955](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9955)).\r\n- fish now sets the terminal window title (via OSC 0) unconditionally instead of only for some terminals ([#10037](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10037)).\r\n- Focus reporting in tmux is no longer disabled on the first prompt.\r\n- Focus reporting is now disabled during commands run inside key bindings ([#6942](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6942)).\r\n- Cursor changes are applied to all terminals that support them, and the list of specifically-supported terminals has been removed ([#10693](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10693)).\r\n- If it cannot find the terminfo entry given by [`TERM`](language.md#envvar-TERM) environment variable, fish will now use an included `xterm-256color` definition to match the vast majority of current terminal emulators ([#10905](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10905)). If you need to have a specific terminfo profile for your terminal\u2019s `TERM` variable, install it into the terminfo database.\r\n- Further improvements to the correct display of prompts which fill the width of the terminal ([#8164](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8164)).\r\n\r\n### Other improvements\r\n\r\n- `status` gained a `buildinfo` subcommand, to print information on how fish was built, to help with debugging ([#10896](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10896)).\r\n- `fish_indent` will now collapse multiple empty lines into one ([#10325](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10325)).\r\n- `fish_indent` now preserves the modification time of files if there were no changes ([#10624](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10624)).\r\n- Performance in launching external processes has been improved for many cases ([#10869](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10869)).\r\n- Performance and interactivity under Windows Subsystem for Linux has been improved, with a workaround for Windows-specific locations being appended to `$PATH` by default ([#10506](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10506)).\r\n- On macOS, paths from `/etc/paths` and `/etc/manpaths` containing colons are handled correctly ([#10684](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10684)).\r\n- Additional filesystems such as AFS are properly detected as remote, which avoids certain hangs due to expensive filesystem locks ([#10818](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10818)).\r\n- A spurious error when launching multiple instances of fish for the first time has been removed ([#10813](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10813)).\r\n\r\n<a id=\"rust-packaging\"></a>\r\n\r\n### For distributors\r\n\r\nfish has been ported to Rust. This means a significant change in dependencies, which are listed in the README. In short, Rust 1.70 or greater is required, and a C++ compiler is no longer needed (although a C compiler is still required, for some C glue code and the tests).\r\n\r\nCMake remains the recommended build system, because of cargo\u2019s limited support for installing support files. Version 3.5 remains the minimum supported version. The Xcode generator for CMake is not supported any longer ([#9924](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9924)). CMake builds default to optimized release builds ([#10799](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10799)).\r\n\r\nfish no longer depends on the ncurses library, but still uses a terminfo database. When packaging fish, please add a dependency on the package containing your terminfo database instead of curses.\r\n\r\nThe `test` target was removed as it can no longer be defined in new CMake versions. Use `make fish_run_tests`. Any existing test target will not print output if it fails ([#11116](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11116)).\r\n\r\nThe Web-based configuration has been rewritten to use Alpine.js ([#9554](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9554)).\r\n\r\n### Changes since fish 4.0b1\r\n\r\nA number of improvements were included in fish 4.0.0 following the beta release of 4.0b1. These include fixes for regressions, improvements to completions and documentation, and the removal of a small number of problematic changes.\r\n\r\nThe full list of fixed issues can be found on the [GitHub milestone page for 4.0-final](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestone/43).\r\n\r\n*Download links: To download the source code for fish, use the file named \"fish-4.0.0.tar.xz\". The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" may not build correctly. The SHA-256 sum of this file is `2fda5bd970357064d8d4c896e08285ba59965ca2a8c4829ca8a82bf3b89c69f3`. A GPG signature from David Adam (key ID `0x7A67D962D88A709A`) is available  is available as \"fish-4.0.0.tar.xz.asc\".*\r\n\r\n*The files called `fish-static-*` are experimental statically linked builds for any linux with the given architecture. Extract and run, and they will extract their data files as needed*",

        "body": "These are the draft release notes for fish 4.0.0. Like this release of fish itself, they are in beta and are not complete. Please report any issues you find.\r\n\r\nfish\u2019s core code has been ported from C++ to Rust ([#9512](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9512)).\r\nThis means a large change in dependencies and how to build fish.\r\nPackagers should see the [For Distributors](#rust-packaging) section at the end.\r\n\r\n### Notable backwards-incompatible changes\r\n\r\n- As part of a larger binding rework, `bind` gained a new key notation.\r\n  In most cases the old notation should keep working, but in rare cases you may have to change a `bind` invocation to use the new notation.\r\n  See [below](#changelog-new-bindings) for details.\r\n- Terminals that fail to ignore unrecognized OSC or CSI sequences may display garbage. We know cool-retro-term and emacs\u2019 ansi-term are affected,\r\n  most mainstream terminals are not.\r\n- `alt-left` and `alt-right` will now move by one argument (which may contain quoted spaces), not just one word like `ctrl-left` and `ctrl-right` do.\r\n- `alt-backspace` will delete an entire argument, not just one word (which is `ctrl-backspace` now).\r\n- `random` will produce different values from previous versions of fish when used with the same seed, and will work more sensibly with small seed numbers.\r\n  The seed was never guaranteed to give the same result across systems,\r\n  so we do not expect this to have a large impact ([#9593](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9593)).\r\n- Variables in command position that expand to a subcommand keyword are now forbidden to fix a likely user error.\r\n  For example, `set editor command emacs; $editor` is no longer allowed ([#10249](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10249)).\r\n- `functions --handlers` will now list handlers in a different order.\r\n  Now it is definition order, first to last, where before it was last to first.\r\n  This was never specifically defined, and we recommend not relying on a specific order ([#9944](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9944)).\r\n- The `qmark-noglob` feature, introduced in fish 3.0, is enabled by default. That means `?` will no longer act as a single-character glob.\r\n  You can, for the time being, turn it back on by adding `no-qmark-noglob` to `fish_features` and restarting fish:\r\n  ```fish-docs-samples\r\n  set -Ua fish_features no-qmark-noglob\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  The flag will eventually be made read-only, making it impossible to turn off.\r\n- fish no longer searches directories from the Windows system/user `$PATH` environment variable for Linux executables. To execute Linux binaries by name (i.e. not with a relative or absolute path) from a Windows folder, make sure the `/mnt/c/...` path is explicitly added to `$fish_user_paths` and not just automatically appended to `$PATH` by `wsl.exe` ([#10506](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10506)).\r\n- Under Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux 1 (not WSL 2) , backgrounded jobs that have not been disowned and do not terminate on their own after a `SIGHUP` + `SIGCONT` sequence will be explicitly killed by fish on exit (after the usual prompt to close or disown them) to work around a WSL 1 deficiency that sees backgrounded processes that run into `SIGTTOU` remain in a suspended state indefinitely ([#5263](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5263)). The workaround is to explicitly `disown` processes you wish to outlive the shell session.\r\n\r\n### Notable improvements and fixes\r\n\r\n<a id=\"changelog-new-bindings\"></a>\r\n- fish now requests XTerm\u2019s `modifyOtherKeys` keyboard encoding and [kitty keyboard protocol\u2019s](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/) progressive enhancements ([#10359](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10359)).\r\n  Depending on terminal support, this allows to binding more key combinations, including arbitrary combinations of modifiers `ctrl`, `alt` and `shift`, and distinguishing (for example) `ctrl-i` from `tab`.\r\n\r\n  Additionally, `bind` now supports a human-readable syntax in addition to byte sequences.\r\n  This includes modifier names, and names for keys like `enter` and `backspace`.\r\n  For example\r\n  - `bind up 'do something'` binds the up-arrow key instead of a two-key sequence (\u201cu\u201d and then \u201cp\u201d)\r\n  - `bind ctrl-x,alt-c 'do something'` binds a sequence of two keys.\r\n\r\n  Any key argument that starts with an ASCII control character (like `\\e` or `\\cX`) or is up to 3 characters long, not a named key, and does not contain `,` or `-` will be interpreted in the old syntax to keep compatibility for the majority of bindings.\r\n- fish can now be built as a self-installing binary ([#10367](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10367)). That means it can be easily built on one system and copied to another, where it can extract supporting files.\r\n  To do this, run:\r\n  ```fish-docs-samples\r\n  cargo install --path . # in a clone of the fish repository\r\n  # or `cargo build --release` and copy target/release/fish{,_indent,_key_reader} wherever you want\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  The first time it runs interactively, it will extract all the data files to  `~/.local/share/fish/install/`. To uninstall, remove the fish binaries and that directory.\r\n\r\n  This build system is experimental; the main build system, using `cmake`, remains the recommended approach for packaging and installation to a prefix.\r\n- A new function `fish_should_add_to_history` can be overridden to decide whether a command should be added to the history ([#10302](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10302)).\r\n- `ctrl-c` during command input no longer prints `^C` and a new prompt, but merely clears the command line. This restores the behavior from version 2.2. To revert to the old behavior, use `bind ctrl-c __fish_cancel_commandline` ([#10213](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10213)).\r\n- Bindings can now mix special input functions and shell commands, so `bind ctrl-g expand-abbr \"commandline -i \\n\"` works as expected ([#8186](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8186)).\r\n- Special input functions run from bindings via `commandline -f` are now applied immediately, instead of after the currently executing binding ([#3031](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3031)).\r\n  For example, `commandline -i foo; commandline | grep foo` succeeds now.\r\n- Undo history is no longer truncated after every command, but kept for the lifetime of the shell process.\r\n- The `ctrl-r` history search now uses glob syntax ([#10131](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10131)).\r\n- The `ctrl-r` history search now operates only on the line or command substitution at cursor, making it easier to combine commands from history.\r\n- Abbreviations can now be restricted to specific commands. For instance:\r\n  ```fish-docs-samples\r\n  abbr --add --command git back 'reset --hard HEAD^'\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  will expand \u201cback\u201d to `reset --hard HEAD^`, but only when the command is `git` ([#9411](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9411)).\r\n\r\n### Deprecations and removed features\r\n\r\n- `commandline --tokenize` (short option `-o`) has been deprecated in favor of `commandline --tokens-expanded` (short option `-x`) which expands variables and other shell syntax, removing the need to use [eval](cmds/eval.md) in completion scripts ([#10212](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10212)).\r\n- Two new feature flags:\r\n  - `remove-percent-self` (see `status features`) disables PID expansion of `%self`, which has been supplanted by `$fish_pid` ([#10262](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10262)).\r\n  - `test-require-arg` disables `test`\u2019s one-argument mode. That means `test -n` without an additional argument will return false, `test -z` will keep returning true. Any other option without an argument, anything that is not an option and no argument will be an error. This also goes for `[`, test\u2019s alternate name.\r\n    This is a frequent source of confusion and so we are breaking with POSIX explicitly in this regard.\r\n    In addition to the feature flag, there is a debug category \u201cdeprecated-test\u201d. Running fish with `fish -d deprecated-test` will show warnings whenever a `test` invocation that would change is used. ([#10365](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10365)).\r\n\r\n  These can be enabled with:\r\n  ```fish-docs-samples\r\n  set -Ua fish_features remove-percent-self test-require-arg\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  We intend to enable them by default in future, and after that eventually make them read-only.\r\n- Specifying key names as terminfo names (using the `bind -k` syntax) is deprecated and may be removed in a future version.\r\n- When a terminal pastes text into fish using bracketed paste, fish used to switch to a special `paste` bind mode.\r\n  This bind mode has been removed. The behavior on paste is no longer configurable.\r\n- When an interactive fish is stopped or terminated by a signal that cannot be caught (SIGSTOP or SIGKILL), it may leave the terminal in a state where keypresses with modifiers are sent as CSI u sequences, instead of traditional control characters or escape sequences that are recognized by Readline and compatible programs, such as bash and python.\r\n  If this happens, you can use the `reset` command from `ncurses` to restore the terminal state.\r\n- `fish_key_reader --verbose` no longer shows timing information.\r\n- Terminal information is no longer read from hashed terminfo databases, or termcap databases ([#10269](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10269)). The vast majority of systems use a non-hashed terminfo database, which is still supported.\r\n\r\n### Scripting improvements\r\n\r\n- `for` loops will no longer remember local variables from the previous iteration ([#10525](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10525)).\r\n- A new `history append` subcommand appends a command to the history, without executing it ([#4506](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4506)).\r\n- A new redirection: `<? /path/to/file` will try opening the file as input, and if it doesn\u2019t succeed silently uses `/dev/null` instead.\r\n  This can help with checks like `test -f /path/to/file; and string replace foo bar < /path/to/file`. ([#10387](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10387))\r\n- A new option `commandline --tokens-raw` prints a list of tokens without any unescaping ([#10212](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10212)).\r\n- A new option `commandline --showing-suggestion` tests whether an autosuggestion is currently displayed ([#10586](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10586)).\r\n- `functions` and `type` now show that a function was copied and its source, rather than solely `Defined interactively` ([#6575](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6575)).\r\n- Stack trace now shows line numbers for copied functions ([#6575](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6575)).\r\n- `foo & && bar` is now a syntax error, like in other shells ([#9911](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9911)).\r\n- `if -e foo; end` now prints a more accurate error ([#10000](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10000)).\r\n- `cd` into a directory that is not readable but accessible (permissions `--x`) is now possible ([#10432](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10432)).\r\n- An integer overflow in `string repeat` leading to a near-infinite loop has been fixed ([#9899](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9899)).\r\n- `string shorten` behaves better in the presence of non-printable characters, including fixing an integer overflow that shortened strings more than intended ([#9854](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9854)).\r\n- `string pad` no longer allows non-printable characters as padding ([#9854](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9854)).\r\n- `string repeat` now allows omission of `-n` when the first argument is an integer ([#10282](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10282)).\r\n- `string match` and `replace` have a new `--max-matches` option to return as soon as the specified number of matches have been identified, which can improve performance in scripts ([#10587](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10587)).\r\n- `functions --handlers-type caller-exit` once again lists functions defined as `function --on-job-exit caller`, rather than them being listed by `functions --handlers-type process-exit`.\r\n- A new `set --no-event` option sets or erases variables without triggering a variable event. This can be useful to change a variable in an event handler ([#10480](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10480)).\r\n- Commas in command substitution output are no longer used as separators in brace expansion, preventing a surprising expansion in some cases ([#5048](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5048)).\r\n- Universal variables can now store strings containing invalid UTF-8 ([#10313](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10313)).\r\n- A new `path basename -E` option that causes it to return the basename (\u201cfilename\u201d with the directory prefix removed) with the final extension (if any) also removed. This is a shorter version of `path change-extension \"\" (path basename $foo)` ([#10521](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10521)).\r\n- A new `math --scale-mode` option to select `truncate`, `round`, `floor`, `ceiling` as you wish; the default value is `truncate`. ([#9117](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9117)).\r\n- `random` is now less strict about its arguments, allowing a start larger or equal to the end. ([#10879](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10879))\r\n\r\n### Interactive improvements\r\n\r\n- Autosuggestions were sometimes not shown after recalling a line from history, which has been fixed ([#10287](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10287)).\r\n- Up-arrow search matches -- which are highlighted in reverse colors -- are no longer syntax-highlighted, to fix bad contrast with the search match highlighting.\r\n- Command abbreviations (those with `--position command` or without a `--position`) now also expand after decorators like `command` ([#10396](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10396)).\r\n- Abbreviations now expand after process separators like `;` and `|`. This fixes a regression in version 3.6 ([#9730](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9730)).\r\n- When exporting interactively defined functions (using `type`, `functions` or `funcsave`) the function body is now indented, to match the interactive command line editor ([#8603](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8603)).\r\n- `ctrl-x` (`fish_clipboard_copy`) on multiline commands now includes indentation ([#10437](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10437)).\r\n- `ctrl-v` (`fish_clipboard_paste`) now strips ASCII control characters from the pasted text.\r\n  This is consistent with normal keyboard input ([#5274](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5274)).\r\n- When a command like `fg %2` fails to find the given job, it no longer behaves as if no job spec was given ([#9835](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9835)).\r\n- Redirection in command position like `>echo` is now highlighted as error ([#8877](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8877)).\r\n- `fish_vi_cursor` now works properly inside the prompt created by builtin `read` ([#10088](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10088)).\r\n- fish no longer fails to open a FIFO if interrupted by a terminal resize signal ([#10250](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10250)).\r\n- `read --help` and friends no longer ignore redirections. This fixes a regression in version 3.1 ([#10274](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10274)).\r\n- Measuring a command with `time` now considers the time taken for command substitution ([#9100](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9100)).\r\n- `fish_add_path` now automatically enables verbose mode when used interactively (in the command line), in an effort to be clearer about what it does ([#10532](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10532)).\r\n- fish no longer adopts TTY modes of failed commands ([#10603](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10603)).\r\n- complete -e cmd now prevents autoloading completions for cmd ([#6716](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6716)).\r\n- fish\u2019s default color scheme no longer uses the color \u201cblue\u201d, as it has bad contrast against the background in a few terminal\u2019s default palettes ([#10758](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10758), [#10786](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10786))\r\n  The color scheme will not be upgraded for existing installs. If you want, you should select it again via `fish_config`.\r\n- Command lines which are larger than the terminal are now displayed correctly, instead of multiple blank lines being displayed ([#7296](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7296)).\r\n- Prompts that use external commands will no longer produce an infinite loop if the command crashes ([#9796](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9796)).\r\n\r\n#### New or improved bindings\r\n\r\n- When the cursor is on a command that resolves to an executable script, `alt-o` will now open that script in your editor ([#10266](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10266)).\r\n- During up-arrow history search, `shift-delete` will delete the current search item and move to the next older item. Previously this was only supported in the history pager.\r\n- `shift-delete` will also remove the currently-displayed autosuggestion from history, and remove it as a suggestion.\r\n- `ctrl-Z` (also known as `ctrl-shift-z`) is now bound to redo.\r\n- `alt-delete` now deletes the argument (which may contain quoted spaces) right of the cursor.\r\n- Some improvements to the `alt-e` binding which edits the command line in an external editor:\r\n  - The editor\u2019s cursor position is copied back to fish. This is currently supported for Vim and Kakoune.\r\n  - Cursor position synchronization is only supported for a set of known editors, which are now also detected in aliases which use `complete --wraps`. For example, use `complete --wraps my-vim vim` to synchronize cursors when `EDITOR=my-vim`.\r\n  - Multiline commands are indented before being sent to the editor, which matches how they are displayed in fish.\r\n- The `...-path-component` bindings, like `backward-kill-path-component`, now treat `#` as part of a path component ([#10271](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10271)).\r\n- Bindings like `alt-l` that print output in between prompts now work correctly with multiline commandlines.\r\n- `ctrl-c` no longer cancels builtin `read`.\r\n- `alt-d` on an empty command line lists the directory history again. This restores the behavior of version 2.1.\r\n- `history-prefix-search-backward` and `-forward` now maintain the cursor position, instead of moving the cursor to the end of the command line ([#10430](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10430)).\r\n- The following keys have refined behavior if the terminal supports [the new keyboard encodings](#changelog-new-bindings):\r\n  - `shift-enter` now inserts a newline instead of executing the command line.\r\n  - `ctrl-backspace` now deletes the last word instead of only one character ([#10741](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10741)).\r\n  - `ctrl-delete` deletes the next word (same as `alt-d`).\r\n- New special input functions:\r\n  - `forward-char-passive` and `backward-char-passive` are like their non-passive variants but do not accept autosuggestions or move focus in the completion pager ([#10398](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10398)).\r\n  - `forward-token`, `backward-token`, `kill-token`, and `backward-kill-token` are similar to the `*-bigword` variants but for the whole argument token which includes escaped spaces ([#2014](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2014)).\r\n- The `accept-autosuggestion` special input function now returns false when there was nothing to accept ([#10608](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10608)).\r\n- Vi mode has seen some improvements but continues to suffer from the lack of people working on it.\r\n  - New default cursor shapes for insert and replace mode.\r\n  - Insert-mode `ctrl-n` accepts autosuggestions ([#10339](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10339)).\r\n  - Outside insert mode, the cursor will no longer be placed beyond the last character on the commandline.\r\n  - When the cursor is at the end of the commandline, a single `l` will accept an autosuggestion ([#10286](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10286)).\r\n  - The cursor position after pasting (`p`) has been corrected.\r\n  - When the cursor is at the start of a line, escaping from insert mode no longer moves the cursor to the previous line.\r\n  - Added bindings for clipboard interaction, like `\",+,p` and `\",+,y,y`.\r\n  - Deleting in visual mode now moves the cursor back, matching vi ([#10394](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10394)).\r\n  - Support `%` motion ([#10593](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10593)).\r\n  - Support ab and ib vi text objects. New input functions are introduced `jump-{to,till}-matching-bracket` ([#1842](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1842)).\r\n  - The `E` binding now correctly handles the last character of the word, by jumping to the next word ([#9700](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9700)).\r\n\r\n#### Completions\r\n\r\n- Command-specific tab completions may now offer results whose first character is a period. For example, it is now possible to tab-complete `git add` for files with leading periods. The default file completions hide these files, unless the token itself has a leading period ([#3707](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3707)).\r\n- Option completion now uses fuzzy subsequence filtering, just like non-option completion ([#830](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/830)).\r\n  This means that `--fb` may be completed to `--foobar` if there is no better match.\r\n- Completions that insert an entire token now use quotes instead of backslashes to escape special characters ([#5433](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5433)).\r\n- Historically, file name completions are provided after the last `:`  or `=` within a token.\r\n  This helps commands like `rsync --files-from=`.\r\n  If the `=` or `:` is actually part of the filename, it will be escaped as `\\:` and `\\=`,\r\n  and no longer get this special treatment.\r\n  This matches Bash\u2019s behavior.\r\n- Various new completion scripts and numerous updates to existing ones.\r\n- Generated completions are now stored in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/fish` or `~/.cache/fish` by default ([#10369](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10369))\r\n\r\n#### Improved terminal support\r\n\r\n- fish now marks the prompt and command-output regions (via OSC 133) to enable terminal shell integration ([#10352](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10352)).\r\n  Shell integration shortcuts can scroll to the next/previous prompt or show the last command output in a pager.\r\n- fish now reports the working directory (via OSC 7) unconditionally instead of only for some terminals ([#9955](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9955)).\r\n- fish now sets the terminal window title (via OSC 0) unconditionally instead of only for some terminals ([#10037](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10037)).\r\n- Focus reporting in tmux is no longer disabled on the first prompt.\r\n- Focus reporting is now disabled during commands run inside key bindings ([#6942](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6942)).\r\n- Cursor changes are applied to all terminals that support them, and the list of specifically-supported terminals has been removed ([#10693](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10693)).\r\n- If it cannot find the terminfo entry given by [`TERM`](language.md#envvar-TERM) environment variable, fish will now use an included `xterm-256color` definition to match the vast majority of current terminal emulators ([#10905](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10905)). If you need to have a specific terminfo profile for your terminal\u2019s `TERM` variable, install it into the terminfo database.\r\n- Further improvements to the correct display of prompts which fill the width of the terminal ([#8164](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8164)).\r\n\r\n### Other improvements\r\n\r\n- `fish_indent` will now collapse multiple empty lines into one ([#10325](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10325)).\r\n- `fish_indent` now preserves the modification time of files if there were no changes ([#10624](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10624)).\r\n- Performance and interactivity under Windows Subsystem for Linux has been improved, with a workaround for Windows-specific locations being appended to `$PATH` by default ([#10506](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10506)).\r\n- Additional filesystems such as AFS are properly detected as remote, which avoids certain hangs due to expensive filesystem locks ([#10818](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10818)).\r\n\r\n<a id=\"rust-packaging\"></a>\r\n\r\n### For distributors\r\n\r\nfish has been ported to Rust. This means a significant change in dependencies, which are listed in the README. In short, Rust 1.70 or greater is required, and a C++ compiler is no longer needed (although a C compiler is still required, for some C glue code and the tests).\r\n\r\nCMake remains the recommended build system, because of cargo\u2019s limited support for installing support files. Version 3.5 remains the minimum supported version. The Xcode generator for CMake is not supported any longer ([#9924](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9924))\r\n\r\nfish no longer depends on the ncurses library, but still uses a terminfo database. When packaging fish, please add a dependency on the package containing your terminfo database instead of curses.\r\n\r\n*Download links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-4.0b1.tar.xz\". The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" will not build correctly. The SHA-256 sum of this file is `534334e10f85722214e9daff82a57cc3501235523f16f8f131c2344e4ec98da7`. A GPG signature from David Adam (key ID `0x7A67D962D88A709A`) is available as \"fish-4.0b1.tar.xz.asc\".*\r\n\r\n*The files called `fish-static-*` are experimental statically linked builds for any linux with the given architecture. Extract and run, and they will extract their data files as needed*",

        "body": "This release of fish fixes the following problems identified in fish 3.7.0:\r\n\r\n- Deleting the last history entry via `history delete` works again ([#10190](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10190)).\r\n- Wildcards (`*`) will no longer sometimes generate paths that did not exist ([#10205](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10205)).\r\n\r\nThis release also contains some improvements:\r\n\r\n- A crash when trying to run an ELF program with a missing interpreter has been fixed. This crashed in the process after fork, so did not affect the fish process that tried to start the program ([#10199](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10199)).\r\n- `funced` will now always `source` the file after it has written it, even if the contents did not change. This prevents issues if the file was otherwise modified ([#10318](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10318)).\r\n- The warning for when a builtin returns a negative exit code was improved, now mentioning the original status ([#10187](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10187)).\r\n- Added completions for\r\n  - `cobra-cli` ([#10293](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10293))\r\n  - `dmidecode` ([#10368](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10368))\r\n  - `mycli` ([#10309](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10309))\r\n  - `ollama` ([#10327](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10327))\r\n  - `pstree` ([#10317](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10317))\r\n- Some improvements to documentation and completions.\r\n\r\n*Download links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-3.7.1.tar.xz\". The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" will not build correctly. The SHA-256 sum of this file is `614c9f5643cd0799df391395fa6bbc3649427bb839722ce3b114d3bbc1a3b250`. A GPG signature from David Adam (key ID `0x7A67D962D88A709A`) is available as \"fish-3.7.1.tar.xz.asc\".*",

        "body": "This release of fish includes a number of improvements over fish 3.6.4, detailed below. Although work continues on the porting of fish internals to the Rust programming language, that work is not included in this release. fish 3.7.0 and any future releases in the 3.7 series remain C++ programs.\r\n\r\n## Notable improvements and fixes\r\n* Improvements to the history pager, including:\r\n  * The history pager will now also attempt subsequence matches ([#9476](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9476)), so you can find a command line like `git log 3.6.1..Integration_3.7.0` by searching for `gitInt`.\r\n  * Opening the history pager will now fill the search field with a search string if you\u2019re already in a search ([#10005](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10005)). This makes it nicer to search something with `\u2191` and then later decide to switch to the full pager.\r\n  * Closing the history pager with enter will now copy the search text to the commandline if there was no match, so you can continue editing the command you tried to find right away ([#9934](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9934)).\r\n* Performance improvements for command completions and globbing, where supported by the operating system, especially on slow filesystems such as NFS ([#9891](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9891), [#9931](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9931), [#10032](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10032), [#10052](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10052)).\r\n* fish can now be configured to wait a specified amount of time for a multi-key sequence to be completed,  instead of waiting indefinitely. For example, this makes binding `kj` to switching modes in vi mode possible.\r\nThe timeout can be set via the new `fish_sequence_key_delay_ms` variable ([#7401](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7401)), and may be set by default in future versions.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations and removed features\r\n\r\n* `LS_COLORS` is no longer set automatically by the `ls` function ([#10080](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10080)). Users\r\nthat set `.dircolors` should manually import it using other means. Typically this would be `set -gx LS_COLORS (dircolors -c .dircolors | string split ' ')[3]`\r\n\r\n## Scripting improvements\r\n\r\n* Running `exit` with a negative number no longer crashes fish ([#9659](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9659)).\r\n* `fish --command` will now return a non-zero status if parsing failed ([#9888](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9888)).\r\n* The `jobs` builtin will now escape the commands it prints ([#9808](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9808)).\r\n* `string repeat` no longer overflows if the count is a multiple of the chunk size ([#9900](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9900)).\r\n* The `builtin` builtin will now properly error out with invalid arguments instead of doing nothing and returning true ([#9942](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9942)).\r\n* `command time` in a pipeline is allowed again, as is `command and` and `command or` ([#9985](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9985)).\r\n* `exec` will now also apply variable overrides, so `FOO=bar exec` will now set `$FOO` correctly ([#9995](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9995)).\r\n* `umask` will now handle empty symbolic modes correctly, like `umask u=,g=rwx,o=` ([#10177](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10177)).\r\n* Improved error messages for errors occurring in command substitutions ([#10054](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10054)).\r\n\r\n## Interactive improvements\r\n* `read` no longer enables bracketed paste so it doesn\u2019t stay enabled in combined commandlines like `mysql -p(read --silent)` ([#8285](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8285)).\r\n* Vi mode now uses `fish_cursor_external` to set the cursor shape for external commands ([#4656](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4656)).\r\n* Opening the history search in vi mode switches to insert mode correctly ([#10141](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10141)).\r\n* Vi mode cursor shaping is now enabled in iTerm2 ([#9698](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9698)).\r\n* Working directory reporting is enabled for iTerm2 ([#9955](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9955)).\r\n* Completing commands as root includes commands not owned by root, fixing a regression introduced in fish 3.2.0 ([#9699](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9699)).\r\n* Selection uses `fish_color_selection` for the foreground and background colors, as intended, rather than just the background ([#9717](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9717)).\r\n* The completion pager will no longer sometimes skip the last entry when moving through a long list ([#9833](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9833)).\r\n* The interactive `history delete` interface now allows specifying index ranges like \u201c1..5\u201d ([#9736](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9736)), and `history delete --exact` now properly saves the history ([#10066](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10066)).\r\n* Command completion will now call the stock `manpath` on macOS, instead of a potential Homebrew version. This prevents awkward error messages ([#9817](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9817)).\r\n* A new bind function `history-pager-delete`, bound to `Shift` + `Delete` by default, will delete the currently-selected history pager item from history ([#9454](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9454)).\r\n* `fish_key_reader` will now use printable characters as-is, so pressing \u201c\u00f6\u201d no longer leads to it telling you to bind `\\\\u00F6` ([#9986](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9986)).\r\n* `open` can be used to launch terminal programs again, as an `xdg-open` bug has been fixed and a workaround has been removed  ([#10045](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10045)).\r\n* The `repaint-mode` binding will now only move the cursor if there is repainting to be done. This fixes `Alt` combination bindings in vi mode ([#7910](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7910)).\r\n* A new `clear-screen` bind function is used for `Ctrl` + `l` by default. This clears the screen and repaints the existing prompt at first,\r\nso it eliminates visible flicker unless the terminal is very slow ([#10044](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10044)).\r\n* The `alias` convenience function has better support for commands with unusual characters, like `+` ([#8720](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8720)).\r\n* A longstanding issue where items in the pager would sometimes display without proper formatting has been fixed ([#9617](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9617)).\r\n* The `Alt` + `l` binding, which lists the directory of the token under the cursor, correctly expands tilde (`~`) to the home directory ([#9954](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9954)).\r\n* Various fish utilities that use an external pager will now try a selection of common pagers if the `PAGER` environment variable is not set, or write the output to the screen without a pager if there is not one available ([#10074](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10074)).\r\n* Command-specific tab completions may now offer results whose first character is a period. For example, it is now possible to tab-complete `git add` for files with leading periods. The default file completions hide these files, unless the token itself has a leading period ([#3707](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3707)).\r\n\r\n### Improved prompts\r\n* The default theme now only uses named colors, so it will track the terminal\u2019s palette ([#9913](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9913)).\r\n* The Dracula theme has now been synced with upstream ([#9807](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9807)); use `fish_config` to re-apply it to pick up the changes.\r\n* `fish_vcs_prompt` now also supports fossil ([#9497](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9497)).\r\n* Prompts which display the working directory using the `prompt_pwd` function correctly display directories beginning with dashes ([#10169](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10169)).\r\n\r\n### Completions\r\n* Added completions for:\r\n  * `age` and `age-keygen` ([#9813](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9813))\r\n  * `airmon-ng` ([#10116](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10116))\r\n  * `ar` ([#9720](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9720))\r\n  * `blender` ([#9905](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9905))\r\n  * `bws` ([#10165](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10165))\r\n  * `calendar` ([#10138](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10138))\r\n  * `checkinstall` ([#10106](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10106))\r\n  * `crc` ([#10034](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10034))\r\n  * `doctl`\r\n  * `gimp` ([#9904](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9904))\r\n  * `gojq` ([#9740](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9740))\r\n  * `horcrux` ([#9922](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9922))\r\n  * `ibmcloud` ([#10004](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10004))\r\n  * `iwctl` ([#6884](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6884))\r\n  * `java_home` ([#9998](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9998))\r\n  * `krita` ([#9903](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9903))\r\n  * `oc` ([#10034](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10034))\r\n  * `qjs` ([#9723](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9723))\r\n  * `qjsc` ([#9731](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9731))\r\n  * `rename` ([#10136](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10136))\r\n  * `rpm-ostool` ([#9669](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9669))\r\n  * `smerge` ([#10135](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10135))\r\n  * `userdel` ([#10056](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10056))\r\n  * `watchexec` ([#10027](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10027))\r\n  * `wpctl` ([#10043](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10043))\r\n  * `xxd` ([#10137](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10137))\r\n  * `zabbix` ([#9647](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9647))\r\n* The `zfs` completions no longer print errors about setting a read-only variable ([#9705](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9705)).\r\n* The `kitty` completions have been removed in favor of keeping them upstream ([#9750](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9750)).\r\n* `git` completions now support aliases that reference other aliases ([#9992](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9992)).\r\n* The `gw` and `gradlew` completions are loaded properly ([#10127](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10127)).\r\n* Improvements to many other completions.\r\n* Improvements to the manual page completion generator ([#9787](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9787), [#9814](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9814), [#9961](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9961)).\r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n* Improvements and corrections to the documentation.\r\n* The Web-based configuration now uses a more readable style when printed, such as for a keybinding reference ([#9828](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9828)).\r\n* Updates to the German translations ([#9824](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9824)).\r\n* The colors of the Nord theme better match their official style ([#10168](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10168)).\r\n\r\n## For distributors\r\n* The licensing information for some of the derived code distributed with fish was incomplete. Though the license information was present in the source distribution, it was not present in the documentation. This has been corrected ([#10162](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10162)).\r\n* The CMake configure step will now also look for libterminfo as an alternative name for libtinfo, as used in NetBSD curses ([#9794](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9794)).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Download links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-3.7.0.tar.xz\".

It incorrectly allowed these markers to be read on command substitution output, rather than transforming them into a safe internal representation.\r\n\r\nFor example, `echo \\UFDD2HOME` has the same output as `echo $HOME`.\r\n\r\nWhile this may cause unexpected behavior with direct input, this may become a minor security problem if the output is being fed from an external program into a command substitution where this output may not be expected.\r\n\r\n*Download links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-3.6.2.tar.xz\".

        "body": "This release of fish contains a number of fixes for problems identified in fish 3.6.0, as well as some enhancements.\r\n\r\n### Notable improvements and fixes\r\n\r\n* `abbr --erase` now also erases the universal variables used by the old abbr function. That means\r\n\r\n```fish\r\n    abbr --erase (abbr --list)\r\n```\r\n\r\ncan now be used to clean out all old abbreviations ([#9468](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9468)).\r\n* `abbr --add --universal` now warns about `--universal` being non-functional, to make it easier to detect old-style `abbr` calls ([#9475](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9475)).\r\n\r\n### Deprecations and removed features\r\n\r\n* The Web-based configuration for abbreviations has been removed, as it was not functional with the changes abbreviations introduced in 3.6.0 ([#9460](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9460)).\r\n\r\n### Scripting improvements\r\n\r\n* `abbr --list` no longer escapes the abbr name, which is necessary to be able to pass it to `abbr --erase` ([#9470](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9470)).\r\n* `read` will now print an error if told to set a read-only variable, instead of silently doing nothing ([#9346](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9346)).\r\n* `set_color -v` no longer crashes fish ([#9640](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9640)).\r\n\r\n### Interactive improvements\r\n\r\n* Using `fish_vi_key_bindings` in combination with fish\u2019s `--no-config` mode works without locking up the shell ([#9443](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9443)).\r\n* The history pager now uses more screen space, usually half the screen ([#9458](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9458))\r\n* Variables that were set while the locale was C (the default ASCII-only locale) will now properly be encoded if the locale is switched ([#2613](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2613), [#9473](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9473)).\r\n* Escape during history search restores the original command line again (fixing a regression in 3.6.0).\r\n* Using `--help` on builtins now respects the `$MANPAGER` variable, in preference to `$PAGER` ([#9488](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9488)).\r\n* `Control-G` closes the history pager, like other shells ([#9484](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9484)).\r\n* The documentation for the `:`, `[` and `.` builtin commands can now be looked up with `man` ([#9552](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9552)).\r\n* fish no longer crashes when searching history for non-ASCII codepoints case-insensitively ([#9628](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9628)).\r\n* The `Alt-S` binding will now also use `please` if available ([#9635](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9635)).\r\n* Themes that don\u2019t specify every color option can be installed correctly in the Web-based configuration ([#9590](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9590)).\r\n* Compatibility with Midnight Commander\u2019s prompt integration has been improved ([#9540](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9540)).\r\n* A spurious error, noted when using fish in Google Drive directories under WSL 2, has been silenced ([#9550](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9550)).\r\n* Using `read` in `fish_greeting` or similar functions will not trigger an infinite loop ([#9564](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9564)).\r\n* Compatibility when upgrading from old versions of fish (before 3.4.0) has been improved ([#9569](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9569)).\r\n\r\n#### Improved prompts\r\n\r\n* The git prompt will compute the stash count to be used independently of the informative status ([#9572](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9572)).\r\n\r\n#### Completions\r\n\r\n* Added completions for:\r\n  * `apkanalyzer` ([#9558](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9558))\r\n  * `neovim` ([#9543](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9543))\r\n  * `otool`\r\n  * `pre-commit` ([#9521](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9521))\r\n  * `proxychains` ([#9486](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9486))\r\n  * `scrypt` ([#9583](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9583))\r\n  * `stow` ([#9571](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9571))\r\n  * `trash` and helper utilities `trash-empty`, `trash-list`, `trash-put`, `trash-restore` ([#9560](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9560))\r\n  * `ssh-copy-id` ([#9675](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9675))\r\n* Improvements to many completions, including the speed of completing directories in WSL 2 ([#9574](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9574)).\r\n* Completions using `__fish_complete_suffix` are now offered in the correct order, fixing a regression in 3.6.0 ([#8924](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8924)).\r\n* `git` completions for `git-foo`-style commands was restored, fixing a regression in 3.6.0 ([#9457](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9457)).\r\n* File completion now offers `../` and `./` again, fixing a regression in 3.6.0 ([#9477](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9477)).\r\n* The behaviour of completions using `__fish_complete_path` matches standard path completions ([#9285](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9285)).\r\n\r\n### Other improvements\r\n\r\n* Improvements and corrections to the documentation.\r\n\r\n### For distributors\r\n\r\n* fish 3.6.1 builds correctly on Cygwin ([#9502](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9502)).\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Download links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named

        "body": "## Notable improvements and fixes\r\n* By default, `Control-R` now opens the command history in the pager ([#602](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/602)). This is fully searchable and syntax-highlighted, as an alternative to the incremental search seen in other shells. The new special input function `history-pager` has been added for custom bindings.\r\n* Abbrevations are more flexible ([#9313](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9313), [#5003](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5003), [#2287](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2287)):\r\n  * They may optionally replace tokens anywhere on the command line, instead of only commands\r\n  * Matching tokens may be described using a regular expression instead of a literal word\r\n  * The replacement text may be produced by a fish function, instead of a literal word\r\n  * They may position the cursor anywhere in the expansion, instead of at the end\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```fish\r\nfunction multicd\r\n    echo cd (string repeat -n (math (string length -- $argv[1]) - 1) ../)\r\nend\r\n\r\nabbr --add dotdot --regex '^\\.\\.+$' --function multicd\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis expands `..` to `cd ../`, `...` to `cd ../../` and `....` to `cd ../../../` and so on.\r\n\r\nOr:\r\n\r\n```fish\r\nfunction last_history_item; echo $history[1]; end\r\nabbr -a !! --position anywhere --function last_history_item\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich expands `!!` to the last history item, anywhere on the command line, mimicking other shells\u2019 history expansion.\r\n\r\nSee the documentation for more.\r\n* `path` gained a new `mtime` subcommand to print the modification time stamp for files. For example, this can be used to handle cache file ages ([#9057](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9057)):\r\n\r\n```fish\r\n> touch foo\r\n> sleep 10\r\n> path mtime --relative foo\r\n10\r\n```\r\n* `string` gained a new `shorten` subcommand to shorten strings to a given visible width ([#9156](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9156)):\r\n\r\n```fish\r\n> string shorten --max 10 \"Hello this is a long string\"\r\nHello thi\u2026\r\n```\r\n* `test` (aka `[`) gained `-ot` (older than) and `-nt` (newer than) operators to compare file modification times, and `-ef` to compare whether the arguments are the same file ([#3589](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3589)).\r\n* fish will now mark the extent of many errors with a squiggly line, instead of just a caret (`^`) at the beginning ([#9130](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9130)). For example:\r\n\r\n```fish\r\nchecks/set.fish (line 471): for: a,b: invalid variable name. See `help identifiers`\r\nfor a,b in y 1 z 3\r\n    ^~^\r\n```\r\n* A new function, `fish_delta`, shows changes that have been made in fish\u2019s configuration from the defaults ([#9255](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9255)).\r\n* `set --erase` can now be used with multiple scopes at once, like `set -efglU foo` ([#7711](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7711), [#9280](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9280)).\r\n* `status` gained a new subcommand, `current-commandline`, which retrieves the entirety of the currently-executing command line when called from a function during execution. This allows easier job introspection ([#8905](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8905), [#9296](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9296)).\r\n\r\n## Deprecations and removed features\r\n* The `\\\\x` and `\\\\X` escape syntax is now equivalent. `\\\\xAB` previously behaved the same as `\\\\XAB`, except that it would error if the value \u201cAB\u201d was larger than \u201c7f\u201d (127 in decimal, the highest ASCII value) ([#9247](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9247), [#9245](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9245), [#1352](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1352)).\r\n* The `fish_git_prompt` will now only turn on features if the appropriate variable has been set to a true value (of \u201c1\u201d, \u201cyes\u201d or \u201ctrue\u201d) instead of just checking if it is defined. This allows specifically turning features *off* without having to erase variables, such as via universal variables. If you have defined a variable to a different value and expect it to count as true, you need to change it ([#9274](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9274)).\r\nFor example, `set -g __fish_git_prompt_show_informative_status 0` previously would have enabled informative status (because any value would have done so), but now it turns it off.\r\n* Abbreviations are no longer stored in universal variables. Existing universal abbreviations are still imported, but new abbreviations should be added to `config.fish`.\r\n* The short option `-r` for abbreviations has changed from `rename` to `regex`, for consistency with `string`.\r\n\r\n## Scripting improvements\r\n* `argparse` can now be used without option specifications, to allow using `--min-args`, `--max-args` or for commands that take no options (but might in future) ([#9006](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9006)):\r\n\r\n```fish\r\nfunction my_copy\r\n    argparse --min-args 2 -- $argv\r\n    or return\r\n\r\n    cp $argv\r\nend\r\n```\r\n* `set --show` now shows when a variable was inherited from fish\u2019s parent process, which should help with debugging ([#9029](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9029)):\r\n\r\n```fish\r\n> set --show XDG_DATA_DIRS\r\n$XDG_DATA_DIRS: set in global scope, exported, a path variable with 4 elements\r\n$XDG_DATA_DIRS[1]: |/home/alfa/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share|\r\n$XDG_DATA_DIRS[2]: |/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share|\r\n$XDG_DATA_DIRS[3]: |/usr/local/share|\r\n$XDG_DATA_DIRS[4]: |/usr/share|\r\n$XDG_DATA_DIRS: originally inherited as |/home/alfa/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share:/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share:/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/|\r\n```\r\n* The read limit is now restored to the default when `fish_read_limit` is unset ([#9129](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9129)).\r\n* `math` produces an error for division-by-zero, as well as augmenting some errors with their extent ([#9190](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9190)). This changes behavior in some limited cases, such as:\r\n\r\n```fish\r\nmath min 1 / 0, 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich would previously print \u201c5\u201d (because in floating point division \u201c1 / 0\u201d yields infinite, and 5 is smaller than infinite) but will now return an error.\r\n* `fish_clipboard_copy` and `fish_clipboard_paste` can now be used in pipes ([#9271](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9271)):\r\n\r\n```fish\r\ngit rev-list 3.5.1 | fish_clipboard_copy\r\n\r\nfish_clipboard_paste | string join + | math\r\n```\r\n* `status fish-path` returns a fully-normalised path, particularly noticeable on NetBSD ([#9085](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9085)).\r\n\r\n## Interactive improvements\r\n* If the terminal definition for `TERM` can\u2019t be found, fish now tries using the \u201cxterm-256color\u201d and \u201cxterm\u201d definitions before \u201cansi\u201d and \u201cdumb\u201d. As the majority of terminal emulators in common use are now more or less xterm-compatible (often even explicitly claiming the xterm-256color entry), this should often result in a fully or almost fully usable terminal ([#9026](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9026)).\r\n* A new variable, `fish_cursor_selection_mode`, can be used to configure whether the command line selection includes the character under the cursor (`inclusive`) or not (`exclusive`). The new default is `exclusive`; use `set fish_cursor_selection_mode inclusive` to get the previous behavior back ([#7762](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7762)).\r\n* fish\u2019s completion pager now fills half the terminal on first tab press instead of only 4 rows, which should make results visible more often and save key presses, without constantly snapping fish to the top of the terminal ([#9105](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9105), [#2698](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2698)).\r\n* The `complete-and-search` binding, used with `Shift-Tab` by default, selects the first item in the results immediately ([#9080](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9080)).\r\n* `bind` output is now syntax-highlighted when used interacively.\r\n* `Alt-H` (the default `__fish_man_page binding`) does a better job of showing the manual page of the command under cursor ([#9020](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9020)).\r\n* If `fish_color_valid_path` contains an actual color instead of just modifiers, those will be used for valid paths even if the underlying color isn\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d ([#9159](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9159)).\r\n* The key combination for the QUIT terminal sequence, often `Control-Backslash` (`\\\\x1c`), can now be sused as a binding ([#9234](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9234)).\r\n* fish\u2019s vi mode uses normal xterm-style sequences to signal cursor change, instead of using the iTerm\u2019s proprietary escape sequences. This allows for a blinking cursor and makes it work in complicated scenarios with nested terminals. ([#3741](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3741), [#9172](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9172))\r\n* When running fish on a remote system (such as inside SSH or a container), `Control-X` now copies to the local client system\u2019s clipboard if the terminal supports OSC 52.\r\n* `commandline` gained two new options, `--selection-start` and `--selection-end`, to set the start/end of the current selection ([#9197](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9197), [#9215](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9215)).\r\n* fish\u2019s builtins now handle keyboard interrupts (`Control-C`) correctly ([#9266](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9266)).\r\n\r\n### Completions\r\n* Added completions for:\r\n  * `ark`\r\n  * `asciinema` ([#9257](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9257))\r\n  * `clojure` ([#9272](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9272))\r\n  * `csh`\r\n  * `direnv` ([#9268](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9268))\r\n  * `dive` ([#9082](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9082))\r\n  * `dolphin`\r\n  * `dua` ([#9277](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9277))\r\n  * `efivar` ([#9318](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9318))\r\n  * `eg`\r\n  * `es` ([#9388](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9388))\r\n  * `firefox-developer-edition` and `firefox` ([#9090](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9090))\r\n  * `fortune` ([#9177](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9177))\r\n  * `kb`\r\n  * `kind` ([#9110](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9110))\r\n  * `konsole`\r\n  * `ksh`\r\n  * `loadkeys` ([#9312](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9312))\r\n  * `okular`\r\n  * `op` ([#9300](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9300))\r\n  * `ouch` ([#9405](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9405))\r\n  * `pix`\r\n  * `readelf` ([#8746](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8746), [#9386](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9386))\r\n  * `qshell`\r\n  * `rc`\r\n  * `sad` ([#9145](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9145))\r\n  * `tcsh`\r\n  * `toot`\r\n  * `tox` ([#9078](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9078))\r\n  * `wish`\r\n  * `xed`\r\n  * `xonsh` ([#9389](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9389))\r\n  * `xplayer`\r\n  * `xreader`\r\n  * `xviewer`\r\n  * `yash` ([#9391](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9391))\r\n  * `zig` ([#9083](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9083))\r\n* Improvements to many completions, including making `cd` completion much faster ([#9220](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9220)).\r\n* Completion of tilde (`~`) works properly even when the file name contains an escaped character ([#9073](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9073)).\r\n* fish no longer loads completions if the command is used via a relative path and is not in `PATH` ([#9133](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9133)).\r\n* fish no longer completes inside of comments ([#9320](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9320)).\r\n\r\n### Improved terminal support\r\n* Opening `help` on WSL now uses PowerShell to open the browser if available, removing some awkward UNC path errors ([#9119](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9119)).\r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n* The Web-based configuration tool now works on systems with IPv6 disabled ([#3857](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3857)).\r\n* Aliases can ignore arguments by ending them with `#` ([#9199](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9199)).\r\n* `string` is now faster when reading large strings from stdin ([#9139](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9139)).\r\n* `string repeat` uses less memory and is faster. ([#9124](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9124))\r\n* Builtins are much faster when writing to a pipe or file. ([#9229](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9229)).\r\n* Performance improvements to highlighting ([#9180](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9180)) should make using fish more pleasant on slow systems.\r\n* On 32-bit systems, globs like `\\*` will no longer fail to return some files, as large file support has been enabled.\r\n\r\n## Fixed bugs\r\n* The history search text for a token search is now highlighted correctly if the line contains multiple instances of that text ([#9066](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9066)).\r\n* `process-exit` and `job-exit` events are now generated for all background jobs, including those launched from event handlers ([#9096](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9096)).\r\n* A crash when completing a token that contained both a potential glob and a quoted variable expansion was fixed ([#9137](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9137)).\r\n* `prompt_pwd` no longer accidentally overwrites a global or universal `$fish_prompt_pwd_full_dirs` when called with the `-d` or `--full-length-dirs` option ([#9123](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9123)).\r\n* A bug which caused fish to freeze or exit after running a command which does not preserve the foreground process group was fixed ([#9181](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9181)).\r\n* The \u201cDisco\u201d sample prompt no longer prints an error in some working directories ([#9164](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9164)). If you saved this prompt, you should run `fish_config prompt save disco` again.\r\n* fish launches external commands via the given path again, rather than always using an absolute path. This behaviour was inadvertently changed in 3.5.0 and is visible, for example, when launching a bash script which checks `$0` ([#9143](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9143)).\r\n* `printf` no longer tries to interpret the first argument as an option ([#9132](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9132)).\r\n* Interactive `read` in scripts will now have the correct keybindings again ([#9227](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9227)).\r\n* A possible stack overflow when recursively evaluating substitutions has been fixed ([#9302](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9302)).\r\n* A crash with relative $CDPATH has been fixed ([#9407](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9407)).\r\n* `printf` now properly fills extra `%d` specifiers with 0 even on macOS and BSD ([#9321](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9321)).\r\n* `fish_key_reader` now correctly exits when receiving a SIGHUP (like after closing the terminal) ([#9309](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9309)).\r\n* `fish_config theme save` now works as documented instead of erroring out ([#9088](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9088), [#9273](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9273)).\r\n* fish no longer triggers prompts to install command line tools when first run on macOS ([#9343](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9343)).\r\n* `fish_git_prompt` now quietly fails on macOS if the xcrun cache is not yet populated ([#6625](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6625)), working around a potential hang.\r\n\r\n## For distributors\r\n* The vendored PCRE2 sources have been removed. It is recommended to declare PCRE2 as a dependency when packaging fish. If the CMake variable FISH_USE_SYSTEM_PCRE2 is false, fish will now download and build PCRE2 from the official repo ([#8355](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8355), [#8363](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8363)). Note this variable defaults to true if PCRE2 is found installed on the system.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDownload links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-3.6.0.tar.xz\". The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" will not build correctly. The SHA-256 sum of this file is `97044d57773ee7ca15634f693d917ed1c3dc0fa7fde1017f1626d60b83ea6181`. A GPG signature from David Adam (key ID `0x7A67D962D88A709A`) is available as \"fish-3.6.0.tar.xz.asc\".",

        "body": "This release of fish introduces the following small enhancements:\r\n\r\n* Cursor shaping for Vi mode is enabled by default in tmux, and will be used if the outer terminal is capable ([#8981](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8981)).\r\n* `printf` returns a better error when used with arguments interpreted as octal numbers ([#9035](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9035)).\r\n* `history merge` when in private mode is now an error, rather than wiping out other sessions\u2019 history ([#9050](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9050)).\r\n* The error message when launching a command that is built for the wrong architecture on macOS is more helpful ([#9052](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9052)).\r\n* Added completions for:\r\n    * `choose` ([#9065](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9065))\r\n    * `expect` ([#9060](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9060))\r\n    * `navi` ([#9064](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9064))\r\n    * `qdbus` ([#9031](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9031))\r\n    * `reflector` ([#9027](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9027))\r\n* Improvements to some completions.\r\n\r\nThis release also fixes a number of problems identified in fish 3.5.0.\r\n\r\n* Completing `git blame` or `git -C` works correctly ([#9053](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9053)).\r\n* On terminals that emit a `CSI u` sequence for `Shift-Space`, fish inserts a space instead of printing an error. ([#9054](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9054)).\r\n* `status fish-path` on Linux-based platforms could print the path with a \u201d (deleted)\u201d suffix (such as `/usr/bin/fish (deleted)`), which is now removed ([#9019](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9019)).\r\n* Cancelling an initial command (from fish\u2019s `--init-command` option) with `Control-C` no longer prevents configuration scripts from running ([#9024](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9024)).\r\n* The job summary contained extra blank lines if the prompt used multiple lines, which is now fixed ([#9044](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9044)).\r\n* Using special input functions in bindings, in combination with `and`/`or` conditionals, no longer crashes ([#9051](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9051)).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Download links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-3.5.1.tar.xz\". The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" will not build correctly. The SHA-256 sum of this file is `a6d45b3dc5a45dd31772e7f8dfdfecabc063986e8f67d60bd7ca60cc81db6928`. A GPG signature from David Adam (key ID `0x7A67D962D88A709A`) is available as \"fish-3.5.1.tar.xz.asc\".*",

        "body": "### Notable improvements and fixes\r\n* A new `path` builtin command to filter and transform paths ([#7659](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7659), [#8958](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8958)). For example, to list all the separate extensions used on files in /usr/share/man (after removing one extension, commonly a \u201c.gz\u201d):\r\n\r\n```fish\r\npath filter -f /usr/share/man/** | path change-extension '' | path extension | path sort -u\r\n```\r\n* Tab (or any key bound to `complete`) now expands wildcards instead of invoking completions, if there is a wildcard in the path component under the cursor ([#954](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/954), [#8593](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8593)).\r\n* Scripts can now catch and handle the SIGINT and SIGTERM signals, either via `function --on-signal` or with `trap` ([#6649](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6649)).\r\n\r\n### Deprecations and removed features\r\n* The `stderr-nocaret` feature flag, introduced in fish 3.0 and enabled by default in fish 3.1, has been made read-only.\r\nThat means it is no longer possible to disable it, and code supporting the `^` redirection has been removed ([#8857](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8857), [#8865](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8865)).\r\n\r\nTo recap: fish used to support `^` to redirect stderr, so you could use commands like:\r\n\r\n```fish\r\ntest \"$foo\" -gt 8 ^/dev/null\r\n```\r\n\r\nto ignore error messages. This made the `^` symbol require escaping and quoting, and was a bit of a weird shortcut considering `2>` already worked, which is only one character longer.\r\n\r\nSo the above can simply become:\r\n\r\n```fish\r\ntest \"$foo\" -gt 8 2>/dev/null\r\n```\r\n* The following feature flags have been enabled by default:\r\n    * `regex-easyesc`, which makes `string replace -r` not do a superfluous round of unescaping in the replacement expression.\r\nThat means e.g. to escape any \u201ca\u201d or \u201cb\u201d in an argument you can use `string replace -ra '([ab])' '\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\$1' foobar` instead of needing 8 backslashes.\r\n\r\nThis only affects the *replacement* expression, not the *match* expression (the `'([ab])'` part in the example).\r\nA survey of plugins on GitHub did not turn up any affected code, so we do not expect this to affect many users.\r\n\r\nThis flag was introduced in fish 3.1.\r\n    * `ampersand-nobg-in-token`, which means that `&` will not create a background job if it occurs in the middle of a word. For example, `echo foo&bar` will print \u201cfoo&bar\u201d instead of running `echo foo` in the background and then starting `bar` as a second job.\r\n\r\nReformatting with `fish_indent` would already introduce spaces, turning `echo foo&bar` into `echo foo & bar`.\r\n\r\nThis flag was introduced in fish 3.4.\r\n\r\nTo turn off these flags, add `no-regex-easyesc` or `no-ampersand-nobg-in-token` to `fish_features\\`` and restart fish:\r\n\r\n```fish\r\nset -Ua fish_features no-regex-easyesc\r\n```\r\n\r\nLike `stderr-nocaret`, they will eventually be made read-only.\r\n* Most `string` subcommands no longer append a newline to their input if the input didn\u2019t have one ([#8473](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8473), [#3847](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3847))\r\n* Fish\u2019s escape sequence removal (like for `string length --visible` or to figure out how wide the prompt is) no longer has special support for non-standard color sequences like from Data General terminals, e.g. the Data General Dasher D220 from 1984. This removes a bunch of work in the common case, allowing `string length --visible` to be much faster with unknown escape sequences. We don\u2019t expect anyone to have ever used fish with such a terminal ([#8769](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8769)).\r\n* Code to upgrade universal variables from fish before 3.0 has been removed. Users who upgrade directly from fish versions 2.7.1 or before will have to set their universal variables & abbreviations again. ([#8781](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8781))\r\n* The meaning of an empty color variable has changed ([#8793](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8793)). Previously, when a variable was set but empty, it would be interpreted as the \u201cnormal\u201d color. Now, empty color variables cause the same effect as unset variables - the general highlighting variable for that type is used instead. For example:\r\n\r\n```fish\r\nset -g fish_color_command blue\r\nset -g fish_color_keyword\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould previously make keywords \u201cnormal\u201d (usually white in a dark terminal). Now it\u2019ll make them blue. To achieve the previous behavior, use the normal color explicitly: `set -g fish_color_keyword normal`.\r\n\r\nThis makes it easier to make self-contained color schemes that don\u2019t accidentally use color that was set before.\r\n`fish_config` has been adjusted to set known color variables that a theme doesn\u2019t explicitly set to empty.\r\n* `eval` is now a reserved keyword, so it can\u2019t be used as a function name. This follows `set` and `read`, and is necessary because it can\u2019t be cleanly shadowed by a function - at the very least `eval set -l argv foo` breaks. Fish will ignore autoload files for it, so left over `eval.fish` from previous fish versions won\u2019t be loaded.\r\n* The git prompt in informative mode now defaults to skipping counting untracked files, as this was extremely slow. To turn it on, set `__fish_git_prompt_showuntrackedfiles` or set the git config value \u201cbash.showuntrackedfiles\u201d to `true` explicitly (which can be done for individual repositories). The \u201cinformative+vcs\u201d sample prompt already skipped display of untracked files, but didn\u2019t do so in a way that skipped the computation, so it should be quite a bit faster in many cases ([#8980](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8980)).\r\n* The `__terlar_git_prompt` function, used by the \u201cTerlar\u201d sample prompt, has been rebuilt as a configuration of the normal `fish_git_prompt` to ease maintenance, improve performance and add features (like reading per-repo git configuration). Some slight changes remain; users who absolutely must have the same behavior are encouraged to copy the old function ([#9011](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9011), [#7918](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7918), [#8979](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8979)).\r\n\r\n### Scripting improvements\r\n* Quoted command substitution that directly follow a variable expansion (like `echo \"$var$(echo x)\"`) no longer affect the variable expansion ([#8849](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8849)).\r\n* Fish now correctly expands command substitutions that are preceded by an escaped dollar (like `echo \\\\$(echo)`). This regressed in version 3.4.0.\r\n* `math` can now handle underscores (`_`) as visual separators in numbers ([#8611](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8611), [#8496](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8496)):\r\n\r\n```fish\r\nmath 5 + 2_123_252\r\n```\r\n* `math`\u2019s `min` and `max` functions now take a variable number of arguments instead of always requiring 2 ([#8644](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8644), [#8646](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8646)):\r\n\r\n```fish\r\n> math min 8,2,4\r\n2\r\n```\r\n* `read` is now faster as the last process in a pipeline ([#8552](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8552)).\r\n* `string join` gained a new `--no-empty` flag to skip empty arguments ([#8774](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8774), [#8351](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8351)).\r\n* `read` now only triggers the `fish_read` event, not the `fish_prompt` event ([#8797](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8797)). It was supposed to work this way in fish 3.2.0 and later, but both events were emitted.\r\n* The TTY modes are no longer restored when non-interactive shells exit. This fixes wrong tty modes in pipelines with interactive commands. ([#8705](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8705)).\r\n* Some functions shipped with fish printed error messages to standard output, but they now they rightly go to standard error ([#8855](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8855)).\r\n* `jobs` now correctly reports CPU usage as a percentage, instead of as a number of clock ticks ([#8919](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8919)).\r\n* `process-exit` events now fire when the process exits even if the job has not yet exited, fixing a regression in 3.4.1 ([#8914](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8914)).\r\n\r\n### Interactive improvements\r\n* Fish now reports a special error if a command wasn\u2019t found and there is a non-executable file by that name in [`PATH`](language.md#envvar-PATH) ([#8804](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8804)).\r\n* `less` and other interactive commands would occasionally be stopped when run in a pipeline with fish functions; this has been fixed ([#8699](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8699)).\r\n* Case-changing autosuggestions generated mid-token now correctly append only the suffix, instead of duplicating the token ([#8820](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8820)).\r\n* `ulimit` learned a number of new options for the resource limits available on Linux, FreeBSD ande NetBSD, and returns a specific warning if the limit specified is not available on the active operating system ([#8823](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8823), [#8786](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8786)).\r\n* The `vared` command can now successfully edit variables named \u201ctmp\u201d or \u201cprompt\u201d ([#8836](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8836), [#8837](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8837)).\r\n* `time` now emits an error if used after the first command in a pipeline ([#8841](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8841)).\r\n* `fish_add_path` now prints a message for skipped non-existent paths when using the `-v` flag ([#8884](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8884)).\r\n* Since fish 3.2.0, pressing `Control-D` while a command is running would end up inserting a space into the next commandline, which has been fixed ([#8871](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8871)).\r\n* A bug that caused multi-line prompts to be moved down a line when pasting or switching modes has been fixed ([#3481](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3481)).\r\n* The Web-based configuration system no longer strips too many quotes in the abbreviation display ([#8917](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8917), [#8918](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8918)).\r\n* Fish started with `--no-config` will now use the default keybindings ([#8493](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8493))\r\n* When fish inherits a [`USER`](language.md#envvar-USER) environment variable value that doesn\u2019t correspond to the current effective user ID, it will now correct it in all cases ([#8879](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8879), [#8583](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8583)).\r\n* Fish sets a new `EUID` variable containing the current effective user id ([#8866](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8866)).\r\n* `history search` no longer interprets the search term as an option ([#8853](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8853))\r\n* The status message when a job terminates should no longer be erased by a multiline prompt ([#8817](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8817))\r\n\r\n#### New or improved bindings\r\n* The `Alt-S` binding will now insert `doas` instead of `sudo` if necessary ([#8942](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8942)).\r\n* The `kill-whole-line` special input function now kills the newline preceeding the last line. This makes `dd` in vi-mode clear the last line properly.\r\n* The new `kill-inner-line` special input function kills the line without any newlines, allowing `cc` in vi-mode to clear the line while preserving newlines ([#8983](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8983)).\r\n* On terminals that emit special sequences for these combinations, `Shift-Space` is bound like `Space`, and `Ctrl-Return` is bound like `Return` ([#8874](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8874)).\r\n\r\n#### Improved prompts\r\n* A new `Astronaut` prompt ([#8775](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8775)), a multi-line prompt using plain text reminiscent of the Starship.rs prompt.\r\n\r\n#### Completions\r\n* Added completions for:\r\n    * `archlinux-java` ([#8911](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8911))\r\n    * `apk` ([#8951](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8951))\r\n    * `brightnessctl` ([#8758](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8758))\r\n    * `efibootmgr` ([#9010](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9010))\r\n    * `fastboot` ([#8904](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8904))\r\n    * `optimus-manager` ([#8913](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8913))\r\n    * `rclone` ([#8819](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8819))\r\n    * `sops` ([#8821](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8821))\r\n    * `tuned-adm` ([#8760](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8760))\r\n    * `wg-quick` ([#8687](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8687))\r\n* `complete` can now be given multiple `--condition` options. They will be attempted in the order they were given, and only if all succeed will the completion be made available (as if they were connected with `&&`). This helps with caching - fish\u2019s complete system stores the return value of each condition as long as the commandline doesn\u2019t change, so this can reduce the number of conditions that need to be evaluated ([#8536](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8536), [#8967](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8967)).\r\n\r\n#### Improved terminal support\r\n* Working directory reporting is enabled for kitty ([#8806](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8806)).\r\n* Changing the cursor shape is now enabled by default in iTerm2 ([#3696](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3696)).\r\n\r\n### For distributors\r\n* libatomic is now correctly detected as necessary when building on RISC-V ([#8850](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8850), [#8851](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8851)).\r\n* In some cases, the build process found the wrong libintl on macOS. This has been corrected ([#5244](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5244)).\r\n* The paths for completions, functions, and configuration snippets now include\r\nsubdirectories `fish/vendor_completions.d`, `fish/vendor_functions.d`, and\r\n`fish/vendor_conf.d` (respectively) within `XDG_DATA_HOME` (or `~/.local/share`\r\nif not defined) ([#8887](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8887), [#7816](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7816)).\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n*Download links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-3.5.0.tar.xz\".

This has been corrected ([#8790](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8790)).\r\n* `funcsave -q` and `funcsave --quiet` now work correctly ([#8830](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8830)).\r\n* Issues with the `csharp` and `nmcli` completions were corrected.\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading from version 3.3.1 or before, please also review the release notes for 3.4.0 (included below).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Download links: To download the source code for fish, use the file named \"fish-3.4.1.tar.xz\". The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" has extra build requirements. The SHA-256 sum of this file is `b6f23b3843b04db6b0a90fea1f6f0d0e40cc027b4a732098200863f2864a94ea`.

        "body": "### Notable improvements and fixes\r\n\r\n* fish\u2019s command substitution syntax has been extended: `$(cmd)` now has the same meaning as `(cmd)` but it can be used inside double quotes, to prevent line splitting of the results ([#159](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/159)):\r\n\r\n```fish\r\nfoo (bar | string collect)\r\n# can now be written as\r\nfoo \"$(bar)\"\r\n\r\n# and\r\n\r\nfoo (bar)\r\n# can now be written as\r\nfoo $(bar)\r\n# this will still split on newlines only.\r\n```\r\n* Complementing the `prompt` command in 3.3.0, `fish_config` gained a `theme` subcommand to show and pick from the sample themes (meaning color schemes) directly in the terminal, instead of having to open a Web browser. For example `fish_config theme choose Nord` loads the Nord theme in the current session ([#8132](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8132)). The current theme can be saved with `fish_config theme dump`, and custom themes can be added by saving them in `~/.config/fish/themes/`.\r\n* `set` and `read` learned a new option, `--function`, to set a variable in the function\u2019s top scope. This should be a more familiar way of scoping variables and avoids issues with `--local`, which is actually block-scoped ([#565](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/565), [#8145](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8145)):\r\n\r\n```fish\r\nfunction demonstration\r\n    if true\r\n        set --function foo bar\r\n        set --local baz banana\r\n    end\r\n    echo $foo # prints \"bar\" because $foo is still valid\r\n    echo $baz # prints nothing because $baz went out of scope\r\nend\r\n```\r\n* `string pad` now excludes escape sequences like colors that fish knows about, and a new `--visible` flag to `string length` makes it use that kind of visible width. This is useful to get the number of terminal cells an already colored string would occupy, like in a prompt. ([#8182](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8182), [#7784](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7784), [#4012](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4012)):\r\n\r\n```fish\r\n> string length --visible (set_color red)foo\r\n3\r\n```\r\n* Performance improvements to globbing, especially on systems using glibc. In some cases (large directories with files with many numbers in the names) this almost halves the time taken to expand the glob.\r\n* Autosuggestions can now be turned off by setting `$fish_autosuggestion_enabled` to 0, and (almost) all highlighting can be turned off by choosing the new \u201cNone\u201d theme. The exception is necessary colors, like those which distinguish autosuggestions from the actual command line. ([#8376](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8376))\r\n* The `fish_git_prompt` function, which is included in the default prompts, now overrides `git` to avoid running  commands set by per-repository configuration. This avoids a potential security issue in some circumstances, and has been assigned CVE-2022-20001 ([#8589](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8589)).\r\n\r\n### Deprecations and removed features\r\n\r\n* A new feature flag, `ampersand-nobg-in-token` makes `&` only act as background operator if followed by a separator. In combination with `qmark-noglob`, this allows entering most URLs at the command line without quoting or escaping ([#7991](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7991)). For example:\r\n\r\n```fish\r\n> echo foo&bar # will print \"foo&bar\", instead of running \"echo foo\" in the background and executing \"bar\"\r\n> echo foo & bar # will still run \"echo foo\" in the background and then run \"bar\"\r\n# with both ampersand-nobg-in-token and qmark-noglob, this argument has no special characters anymore\r\n> open https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&feature=youtu.be\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, feature flags can be set on startup with `fish --features ampersand-nobg-in-token,qmark-noglob` or with a universal variable called `fish_features`:\r\n\r\n```fish\r\n> set -Ua fish_features ampersand-nobg-in-token\r\n```\r\n* `$status` is now forbidden as a command, to prevent a surprisingly common error among new users: Running `if $status` ([#8171](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8171)). This applies *only* to `$status`, other variables are still allowed.\r\n* `set --query` now returns an exit status of 255 if given no variable names. This means `if set -q $foo` will not enter the if-block if `$foo` is empty or unset. To restore the previous behavior, use `if not set -q foo; or set -q $foo` - but this is unlikely to be desireable ([#8214](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8214)).\r\n* `_` is now a reserved keyword ([#8342](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8342)).\r\n* The special input functions `delete-or-exit`, `nextd-or-forward-word` and `prevd-or-backward-word` replace fish functions of the same names ([#8538](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8538)).\r\n* Mac OS X 10.9 is no longer supported. The minimum Mac version is now 10.10 \u201cYosemite.\u201d\r\n\r\n### Scripting improvements\r\n\r\n* `string collect` supports a new `--allow-empty` option, which will output one empty argument in a command substitution that has no output ([#8054](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8054)). This allows commands like `test -n (echo -n | string collect --allow-empty)` to work more reliably. Note this can also be written as `test -n \"$(echo -n)\"` (see above).\r\n* `string match` gained a `--groups-only` option, which makes it only output capturing groups, excluding the full match. This allows `string match` to do simple transformations ([#6056](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6056)):\r\n\r\n```fish\r\n> string match -r --groups-only '(.*)fish' 'catfish' 'twofish' 'blue fish' | string escape\r\ncat\r\ntwo\r\n'blue '\r\n```\r\n* `$fish_user_paths` is now automatically deduplicated to fix a common user error of appending to it in config.fish when it is universal ([#8117](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8117)). [fish_add_path](cmds/fish_add_path.md#cmd-fish-add-path) remains the recommended way to add to $PATH.\r\n* `return` can now be used outside functions. In scripts, it does the same thing as `exit`. In interactive mode,it sets `$status` without exiting ([#8148](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8148)).\r\n* An oversight prevented all syntax checks from running on commands given to `fish -c` ([#8171](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8171)). This includes checks such as `exec` not being allowed in a pipeline, and `$$` not being a valid variable. Generally, another error was generated anyway.\r\n* `fish_indent` now correctly reformats tokens that end with a backslash followed by a newline ([#8197](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8197)).\r\n* `commandline` gained an `--is-valid` option to check if the command line is syntactically valid and complete. This allows basic implementation of transient prompts ([#8142](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8142)).\r\n* `commandline` gained a `--paging-full-mode` option to check if the pager is showing all the possible lines (no \u201c7 more rows\u201d message) ([#8485](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8485)).\r\n* List expansion correctly reports an error when used with all zero indexes ([#8213](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8213)).\r\n* Running `fish` with a directory instead of a script as argument (eg `fish .`) no longer leads to an infinite loop. Instead it errors out immediately ([#8258](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8258))\r\n* Some error messages occuring after fork, like \u201ctext file busy\u201d have been replaced by bespoke error messages for fish (like \u201cFile is currently open for writing\u201d). This also restores error messages with current glibc versions that removed sys_errlist ([#8234](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8234), [#4183](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4183)).\r\n* The `realpath` builtin now also squashes leading slashes with the `--no-symlinks` option ([#8281](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8281)).\r\n* When trying to `cd` to a dangling (broken) symbolic link, fish will print an error noting that the target is a broken link ([#8264](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8264)).\r\n* On MacOS terminals that are not granted permissions to access a folder, `cd` would print a spurious \u201crotten symlink\u201d error, which has been corrected to \u201cpermission denied\u201d ([#8264](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8264)).\r\n* Since fish 3.0, `for` loops would trigger a variable handler function before the loop was entered. As the variable had not actually changed or been set, this was a spurious event and has been removed ([#8384](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8384)).\r\n* `math` now correctly prints negative values and values larger than `2\\*\\*31` when in hex or octal bases ([#8417](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8417)).\r\n* `dirs` always produces an exit status of 0, instead of sometimes returning 1 ([#8211](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8211)).\r\n* `cd \"\"` no longer crashes fish ([#8147](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8147)).\r\n* `set --query` can now query whether a variable is a path variable via `--path` or `--unpath` ([#8494](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8494)).\r\n* Tilde characters (`~`) produced by custom completions are no longer escaped when applied to the command line, making it easier to use the output of a recursive `complete -C` in completion scripts ([#4570](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4570)).\r\n* `set --show` reports when a variable is read-only ([#8179](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8179)).\r\n* Erasing `$fish_emoji_width` will reset fish to the default guessed emoji width ([#8274](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8274)).\r\n* The `la` function no longer lists entries for \u201c.\u201d and \u201c..\u201d, matching other systems defaults ([#8519](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8519)).\r\n* `abbr -q` returns the correct exit status when given multiple abbreviation names as arguments ([#8431](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8431)).\r\n* `command -v` returns an exit status of 127 instead of 1 if no command was found ([#8547](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8547)).\r\n* `argparse` with `--ignore-unknown` no longer breaks with multiple unknown options in a short option group ([#8637](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8637)).\r\n* Comments inside command substitutions or brackets now correctly ignore parentheses, quotes, and brackets ([#7866](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7866), [#8022](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8022), [#8695](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8695)).\r\n* `complete -C` supports a new `--escape` option, which turns on escaping in returned completion strings ([#3469](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3469)).\r\n* Invalid byte or unicode escapes like `\\\\Utest` or `\\\\xNotHex` are now a tokenizer error instead of causing the token to be truncated ([#8545](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8545)).\r\n\r\n### Interactive improvements\r\n\r\n* Vi mode cursors are now set properly after `Control-C` ([#8125](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8125)).\r\n* `funced` will try to edit the whole file containing a function definition, if there is one ([#391](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/391)).\r\n* Running a command line consisting of just spaces now deletes an ephemeral (starting with space) history item again ([#8232](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8232)).\r\n* Command substitutions no longer respect job control, instead running inside fish\u2019s own process group ([#8172](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8172)). This more closely matches other shells, and improves `Control-C` reliability inside a command substitution.\r\n* `history` and `__fish_print_help` now properly support `less` before version 530, including the version that ships with macOS. ([#8157](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8157)).\r\n* `help` now knows which section is in which document again ([#8245](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8245)).\r\n* fish\u2019s highlighter will now color options (starting with `-` or `--`) with the color given in the new $fish_color_option, up to the first `--`. It falls back on $fish_color_param, so nothing changes for existing setups ([#8292](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8292)).\r\n* When executing a command, abbreviations are no longer expanded when the cursor is separated from the command by spaces, making it easier to suppress abbreviation expansion of commands without arguments. ([#8423](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8423)).\r\n* `fish_key_reader`\u2019s output was simplified. By default, it now only prints a bind statement. The previous per-character timing information can be seen with a new `--verbose` switch ([#8467](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8467)).\r\n* Custom completions are now also loaded for commands that contain tildes or variables like `~/bin/fish` or `$PWD/fish` ([#8442](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8442)).\r\n* Command lines spanning multiple lines will not be overwritten by the completion pager when it fills the entire terminal ([#8509](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8509), [#8405](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8405)).\r\n* When redrawing a multiline prompt, the old prompt is now properly cleared ([#8163](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8163)).\r\n* Interactive completion would occasionally ignore the last word on the command line due to a race condition. This has been fixed ([#8175](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8175)).\r\n* Propagation of universal variables from a fish process that is closing is faster ([#8209](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8209)).\r\n* The command line is drawn in the correct place if the prompt ends with a newline ([#8298](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8298)).\r\n* `history` learned a new subcommand `clear-session` to erase all history from the current session ([#5791](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5791)).\r\n* Pressing `Control-C` in `fish_key_reader` will no longer print the incorrect \u201cPress [ctrl-C] again to exit\u201d message ([#8510](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8510)).\r\n* The default command-not-found handler for Fedora/PackageKit now passes the whole command line, allowing for functionality such as running the suggested command directly ([#8579](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8579)).\r\n* When looking for locale information, the Debian configuration is now used when available ([#8557](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8557)).\r\n* Pasting text containing quotes from the clipboard trims spaces more appropriately ([#8550](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8550)).\r\n* The clipboard bindings ignore X-based clipboard programs if the `DISPLAY` environment variable is not set, which helps prefer the Windows clipboard when it is available (such as on WSL).\r\n* `funcsave` will remove a saved copy of a function that has been erased with `functions --erase`.\r\n* The Web-based configuration tool gained a number of improvements, including the ability to set pager colors.\r\n* The default `fish_title` prints a shorter title with shortened $PWD and no more redundant \u201cfish\u201d ([#8641](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8641)).\r\n* Holding down an arrow key won\u2019t freeze the terminal with long periods of flashing ([#8610](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8610)).\r\n* Multi-char bindings are no longer interrupted if a signal handler enqueues an event. ([#8628](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8628)).\r\n\r\n#### New or improved bindings\r\n\r\n* `Escape` can now bound without breaking arrow key bindings ([#8428](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8428)).\r\n* The `Alt-H` binding (to open a command\u2019s manual page) now also ignores `command` ([#8447](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8447)).\r\n\r\n#### Improved prompts\r\n\r\n* The `fish_status_to_signal` helper function returns the correct signal names for the current platform, rather than Linux ([#8530](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8530)).\r\n* The `prompt_pwd` helper function learned a `--full-length-dirs N` option to keep the last N directory components unshortened. In addition the number of characters to shorten each component should be shortened to can now be given as `-d N` or `--dir-length N`. ([#8208](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8208)):\r\n\r\n```fish\r\n> prompt_pwd --full-length-dirs 2 -d 1 ~/dev/fish-shell/share/tools/web_config\r\n~/d/f/s/tools/web_config\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Completions\r\n\r\n* Added completions for:\r\n    * Apple\u2019s `shortcuts`\r\n    * `argparse` ([#8434](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8434))\r\n    * `asd` ([#8759](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8759))\r\n    * `az` ([#8141](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8141))\r\n    * `black` ([#8123](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8123))\r\n    * `clasp` ([#8373](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8373))\r\n    * `cpupower` ([#8302](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8302))\r\n    * `dart` ([#8315](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8315))\r\n    * `dscacheutil`\r\n    * `elvish` ([#8416](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8416))\r\n    * `ethtool` ([#8283](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8283))\r\n    * `exif` ([#8246](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8246))\r\n    * `findstr` ([#8481](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8481))\r\n    * `git-sizer` ([#8156](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8156))\r\n    * `gnome-extensions` ([#8732](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8732))\r\n    * `gping` ([#8181](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8181))\r\n    * `isatty` ([#8609](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8609))\r\n    * `istioctl` ([#8343](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8343))\r\n    * `kmutil`\r\n    * `kubectl` ([#8734](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8734))\r\n    * `matlab` ([#8505](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8505))\r\n    * `mono` ([#8415](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8415)) and related tools `csharp`, `gacutil`, `gendarme`, `ikdasm`, `ilasm`, `mkbundle`, `monodis`, `monop`, `sqlsharp` and `xsp` ([#8452](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8452))\r\n    * Angular\u2019s `ng` ([#8111](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8111))\r\n    * `nodeenv` ([#8533](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8533))\r\n    * `octave` ([#8505](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8505))\r\n    * `pabcnet_clear` ([#8421](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8421))\r\n    * `qmk` ([#8180](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8180))\r\n    * `rakudo` ([#8113](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8113))\r\n    * `rc-status` ([#8757](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8757))\r\n    * `roswell` ([#8330](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8330))\r\n    * `sbcl` ([#8330](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8330))\r\n    * `starship` ([#8520](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8520))\r\n    * `topgrade` ([#8651](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8651))\r\n    * `wine`, `wineboot` and `winemaker` ([#8411](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8411))\r\n    * Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)\u2019s `wslpath` ([#8364](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8364))\r\n    * Windows\u2019 `color` ([#8483](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8483)), `attrib`, `attributes`, `choice`, `clean`, `cleanmgr`, `cmd`, `cmdkey`, `comp`, `forfiles`, `powershell`, `reg`, `schtasks`, `setx` ([#8486](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8486))\r\n    * `zef` ([#8114](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8114))\r\n* Improvements to many completions, especially for `git` aliases ([#8129](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8129)), subcommands ([#8134](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8134)) and submodules ([#8716](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8716)).\r\n* Many adjustments to complete correct options for system utilities on BSD and macOS.\r\n* When evaluating custom completions, the command line state no longer includes variable overrides (`var=val`). This unbreaks completions that read `commandline -op`.\r\n\r\n#### Improved terminal support\r\n\r\n* Dynamic terminal titles are enabled on WezTerm ([#8121](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8121)).\r\n* Directory history navigation works out of the box with Apple Terminal\u2019s default key settings ([#2330](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2330)).\r\n* fish now assumes Unicode 9+ widths for emoji under iTerm 2 ([#8200](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8200)).\r\n* Skin-tone emoji modifiers (U+1F3FB through U+1F3FF) are now measured as width 0 ([#8275](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8275)).\r\n* fish\u2019s escape sequence removal now also knows Tmux\u2019s wrapped escapes.\r\n* Vi mode cursors are enabled in Apple Terminal.app ([#8167](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8167)).\r\n* Vi cursor shaping and $PWD reporting is now also enabled on foot ([#8422](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8422)).\r\n* `ls` will use colors also on newer versions of Apple Terminal.app ([#8309](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8309)).\r\n* The `Delete` and `Shift-Tab` keys work more reliably under `st` ([#8352](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8352), [#8354](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8354)).\r\n\r\n### Other improvements\r\n\r\n* Fish\u2019s test suite now uses `ctest`, and has become much faster to run. It is now also possible to run only specific tests with targets named `test_$filename` - `make test_set.fish` only runs the set.fish test. ([#7851](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7851))\r\n* The HTML version of the documentation now includes copy buttons for code examples ([#8218](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8218)).\r\n* The HTML version of the documentation and the web-based configuration tool now pick more modern system fonts instead of falling back to Arial and something like Courier New most of the time ([#8632](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8632)).\r\n* The Debian & Ubuntu package linked from fishshell.com is now a single package, rather than split into `fish` and `fish-common` ([#7845](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7845)).\r\n* The macOS installer does not assert that Rosetta is required to install fish on machines with Apple Silicon ([#8566](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8566)).\r\n* The macOS installer now cleans up previous .pkg installations when upgrading. ([#2963](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2963)).\r\n\r\n### For distributors\r\n\r\n* The minimum version of CMake required to build fish is now 3.5.0.\r\n* The CMake installation supports absolute paths for `CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR` ([#8150](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8150)).\r\n* Building using NetBSD curses works on any platform ([#8087](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8087)).\r\n* The build system now uses the default linker instead of forcing use of the gold or lld linker ([#8152](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8152)).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Download links: To download the source code for fish, use the file named \"fish-3.4.0.tar.xz\". The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" has extra build requirements. The SHA-256 sum of this file is `b5b48ab8486b19ef716a32f7f46b88b9ea5356155f0e967ee99f4093645413c5`.

        "body": "## Notable improvements and fixes\r\n\r\n* `fish_config` gained a `prompt` subcommand to show and pick from the sample prompts directly in the terminal, instead of having to open a webbrowser. For example `fish_config prompt choose default` loads the default prompt in the current session ([#7958](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7958)).\r\n* The documentation has been reorganized to be easier to understand ([#7773](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7773)).\r\n\r\n## Deprecations and removed features\r\n\r\n* The `$fish_history` value \"default\" is no longer special. It used to be treated the same as \"fish\" ([#7650](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7650)).\r\n* Redirection to standard error with the `^` character has been disabled by default. It can be turned back on using the `stderr-nocaret` feature flag, but will eventually be disabled completely ([#7105](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7105)).\r\n* Specifying an initial tab to `fish_config` now only works with `fish_config browse` (e.g. `fish_config browse variables`), otherwise it would interfere with the new `prompt` subcommand (see below) ([#7958](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7958)).\r\n\r\n## Scripting improvements\r\n\r\n* `math` gained new functions `log2` (like the documentation claimed), `max` and `min` ([#7856](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7856)). `math` functions can be used without the parentheses (eg `math sin 2 + 6`), and functions have the lowest precedence in the order of operations ([#7877](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7877)).\r\n* Shebang (`#!`) lines are no longer required within shell scripts, improving support for scripts with concatenated binary contents. If a file fails to execute and passes a (rudimentary) binary safety check, fish will re-invoke it using `/bin/sh` ([#7802](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7802)).\r\n* Exit codes are better aligned with bash. A failed execution now reports `$status` of 127 if the file is not found, and 126 if it is not executable.\r\n* `echo` no longer writes its output one byte at a time, improving performance and allowing use with Linux's special API files (`/proc`, `/sys` and such) ([#7836](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7836)).\r\n* fish should now better handle `cd` on filesystems with broken `stat(3)` responses ([#7577](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7577)).\r\n* Builtins now properly report a `$status` of 1 upon unsuccessful writes ([#7857](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7857)).\r\n* `string match` with unmatched capture groups and without the `--all` flag now sets an empty variable instead of a variable containing the empty string. It also correctly imports the first match if multiple arguments are provided, matching the documentation. ([#7938](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7938)).\r\n* fish produces more specific errors when a command in a command substitution wasn't found or is not allowed. This now prints something like \"Unknown command\" instead of \"Unknown error while evaluating command substitution\".\r\n* `fish_indent` allows inline variable assignments (`FOO=BAR command`) to use line continuation, instead of joining them into one line ([#7955](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7955)).\r\n* fish gained a `--no-config` option to disable configuration files. This applies to user-specific and the systemwide `config.fish` (typically in `/etc/fish/config.fish`), and configuration snippets (typically in `conf.d` directories). It also disables universal variables, history, and loading of functions from system or user configuration directories ([#7921](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7921), [#1256](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1256)).\r\n* When universal variables are unavailable for some reason, setting a universal variable now sets a global variable instead ([#7921](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7921)).\r\n* `$last_pid` now contains the process ID of the last process in the pipeline, allowing it to be used in scripts ([#5036](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5036), [#5832](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5832), [#7721](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7721)). Previously, this value contained the process group ID, but in scripts this was the same as the running fish's process ID.\r\n* `process-exit` event handlers now receive the same value as `$status` in all cases, instead of receiving -1 when the exit was due to a signal.\r\n* `process-exit` event handlers for PID 0 also received `JOB_EXIT` events; this has been fixed.\r\n* `job-exit` event handlers may now be created with any of the PIDs from the job. The handler is passed the last PID in the job as its second argument, instead of the process group.\r\n* Trying to set an empty variable name with `set` no longer works (these variables could not be used in expansions anyway).\r\n* `fish_add_path` handles an undefined `PATH` environment variable correctly ([#8082](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8082)).\r\n\r\n## Interactive improvements\r\n\r\n* Commands entered before the previous command finishes will now be properly syntax highlighted.\r\n* fish now automatically creates `config.fish` and the configuration directories in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fish` (by default `~/.config/fish`) if they do not already exist ([#7402](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7402)).\r\n* `$SHLVL` is no longer incremented in non-interactive shells. This means it won't be set to values larger than 1 just because your environment happens to run some scripts in $SHELL in its startup path ([#7864](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7864)).\r\n* fish no longer rings the bell when flashing the command line. The flashing should already be enough notification and the bell can be annoying ([#7875](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7875)).\r\n* `fish --help` is more helpful if the documentation isn't installed ([#7824](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7824)).\r\n* `funced` won't include an entry on where a function is defined, thanks to the new `functions --no-details` option ([#7879](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7879)).\r\n* A new variable, `fish_killring`, containing entries from the killring, is now available ([#7445](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7445)).\r\n* `fish --private` prints a note on private mode on startup even if `$fish_greeting` is an empty list ([#7974](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7974)).\r\n* fish no longer attempts to lock history or universal variable files on remote filesystems, including NFS and Samba mounts. In rare cases, updates to these files may be dropped if separate fish instances modify them simultaneously. ([#7968](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7968)).\r\n* `wait` and `on-process-exit` work correctly with jobs that have already exited ([#7210](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7210)).\r\n* `__fish_print_help` (used for `--help` output for fish's builtins) now respects the `LESS` environment variable, and if not set, uses better default pager settings ([#7997](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7997)).\r\n* Errors from `alias` are now printed to standard error, matching other builtins and functions ([#7925](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7925)).\r\n* `ls` output is colorized on OpenBSD if colorls utility is installed ([#8035](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8035))\r\n* The default pager color looks better in terminals with light backgrounds ([#3412](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3412)).\r\n* Further robustness improvements to the bash history import ([#7874](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7874)).\r\n* fish now tries to find a Unicode-aware locale for encoding (`LC_CTYPE`) if started without any locale information, improving the display of emoji and other non-ASCII text on misconfigured systems ([#8031](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8031)). To allow a C locale, set the variable `fish_allow_singlebyte_locale` to 1.\r\n* The Web-based configuration and documentation now feature a dark mode if the browser requests it ([#8043](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8043)).\r\n* Color variables can now also be given like `--background red` and `-b red`, not just `--background=red` ([#8053](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8053)).\r\n* `exit` run within `fish_prompt` now exits properly ([#8033](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8033)).\r\n* When attempting to execute the unsupported POSIX-style brace command group (`{ ... }`) fish will suggest its equivalent `begin; ...; end` commands ([#6415](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6415)).\r\n\r\n### New or improved bindings\r\n\r\n* Pasting in Vi mode puts text in the right place in normal mode ([#7847](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7847)).\r\n* Vi mode's `u` is bound to `undo` instead of `history-search-backward`, following GNU readline's behavior. Similarly, `Control-R` is bound to `redo` instead of `history-search-backward`, following Vim ([#7908](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7908)).\r\n* `s` in Vi visual mode now does the same thing as `c` ([#8039](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8039)).\r\n* The binding for `\"\\*y` now uses `fish_clipboard_copy`, allowing it to support more than just `xsel`.\r\n* The `Control-Space` binding can be correctly customised ([#7922](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7922)).\r\n* `exit` works correctly in bindings ([#7967](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7967)).\r\n* The `F1` binding, which opens the manual page for the current command, now works around a bug in certain `less` versions that fail to clear the screen ([#7863](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7863)).\r\n* The binding for `Alt-S` now toggles whether `sudo` is prepended, even when it took the commandline from history instead of only adding it.\r\n* The new functions `fish_commandline_prepend` and `fish_commandline_append` allow toggling the presence of a prefix/suffix on the current commandline. ([#7905](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7905)).\r\n* `backward-kill-path-component` `Control-W`) no longer erases parts of two tokens when the cursor is positioned immediately after `/`. ([#6258](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6258)).\r\n\r\n### Improved prompts\r\n\r\n* The default Vi mode prompt now uses foreground instead of background colors, making it less obtrusive ([#7880](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7880)).\r\n* Performance of the \"informative\" git prompt is improved somewhat ([#7871](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7871)). This is still slower than the non-informative version by its very nature. In particular it is IO-bound, so it will be very slow on slow disks or network mounts.\r\n* The sample prompts were updated. Some duplicated prompts, like the various classic variants, or less useful ones, like the \"justadollar\" prompt were removed, some prompts were cleaned up, and in some cases renamed. A new \"simple\" and \"disco\" prompt were added ([#7884](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7884), [#7897](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7897), [#7930](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7930)). The new prompts will only take effect when selected and existing installed prompts will remain unchanged.\r\n* A new `prompt_login` helper function to describe the kind of \"login\" (user, host and chroot status) for use in prompts. This replaces the old \"debian chroot\" prompt and has been added to the default and terlar prompts ([#7932](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7932)).\r\n* The Web-based configuration's prompt picker now shows and installs right prompts ([#7930](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7930)).\r\n* The git prompt now has the same symbol order in normal and \"informative\" mode, and it's customizable via `$__fish_git_prompt_status_order` ([#7926](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7926)).\r\n\r\n### Completions\r\n\r\n* Added completions for:\r\n    * `firewall-cmd` ([#7900](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7900))\r\n    * `sv` ([#8069](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8069))\r\n* Improvements to plenty of completions!\r\n* Commands that wrap `cd` (using `complete --wraps cd`) get the same completions as `cd` ([#4693](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4693)).\r\n* The `--force-files` option to `complete` works for bare arguments, not just options ([#7920](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7920)).\r\n* Completion descriptions for functions don't include the function definition, making them more concise ([#7911](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7911)).\r\n* The `kill` completions no longer error on MSYS2 ([#8046](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8046)).\r\n* Completion scripts are now loaded when calling a command via a relative path (like `./git`) ([#6001](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6001), [#7992](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7992)).\r\n* When there are multiple completion candidates, fish inserts their shared prefix. This prefix was computed in a case-insensitive way, resulting in wrong case in the completion pager. This was fixed by only inserting prefixes with matching case ([#7744](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7744)).\r\n\r\n### Improved terminal support\r\n\r\n* fish no longer tries to detect a missing new line during startup, preventing an erroneous `\u23ce` from appearing if the terminal is resized at the wrong time, which can happen in tiling window managers ([#7893](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7893)).\r\n* fish behaves better when it disagrees with the terminal on the width of characters. In particular, staircase effects with right prompts should be gone in most cases ([#8011](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8011)).\r\n* If the prompt takes up the entire line, the last character should no longer be chopped off in certain terminals ([#8002](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8002)).\r\n* fish's reflow handling has been disabled by default for kitty ([#7961](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7961)).\r\n* The default prompt no longer produces errors when used with a dumb terminal ([#7904](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7904)).\r\n* Terminal size variables are updated for window size change signal handlers (`SIGWINCH`).\r\n* Pasting within a multi-line command using a terminal that supports bracketed paste works correctly, instead of producing an error ([#7782](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7782)).\r\n* `set_color` produces an error when used with invalid arguments, rather than empty output which interacts badly with Cartesian product expansion.\r\n\r\n## For distributors\r\n\r\n* fish runs correctly on platforms without the `O_CLOEXEC` flag for `open(2)` ([#8023](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8023)).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Download links: To download the source code for fish, use the file named \"fish-3.3.0.tar.xz\".

        "body": "This release of fish fixes the following problems identified in fish 3.2.0:\r\n\r\n* Commands in key bindings are run with fish's internal terminal modes, instead of the terminal modes typically used for commands. This fixes a bug introduced in 3.2.0, where text would unexpectedly appear on the terminal, especially when pasting ([#7770](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7770)).\r\n* Prompts which use the internal `__fish_print_pipestatus` function will display correctly rather than carrying certain modifiers (such as bold) further than intended ([#7771](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7771)).\r\n* Redirections to internal file descriptors is allowed again, reversing the changes in 3.2.0. This fixes a problem with Midnight Commander ([#7769](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7769)).\r\n* Universal variables should be fully reliable regardless of operating system again ([#7774](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7774)).\r\n* `fish_git_prompt` no longer causes screen flickering in certain terminals ([#7775](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7775)).\r\n* `fish_add_path` manipulates the `fish_user_paths` variable correctly when moving multiple paths ([#7776](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7776)).\r\n* Pasting with a multi-line command no longer causes a `__fish_tokenizer_state` error ([#7782](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7782)).\r\n* `psub` inside event handlers cleans up temporary files properly ([#7792](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7792)).\r\n* Event handlers declared with `--on-job-exit $fish_pid` no longer run constantly ([#7721](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7721)), although these functions should use `--on-event fish_exit` instead.\r\n* Changing terminal modes inside `config.fish` works ([#7783](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7783)).\r\n* `set_color --print-colors` no longer prints all colors in bold ([#7805](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7805))\r\n* Completing commands starting with a `-` no longer prints an error ([#7809](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7809)).\r\n* Running `fish_command_not_found` directly no longer produces an error on macOS or other OSes which do not have a handler available ([#7777](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7777)).\r\n* The new `type` builtin now has the (deprecated) `--quiet` long form of `-q` ([#7766](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7766)).\r\n\r\nIt also includes some small enhancements:\r\n\r\n* `help` and `fish_config` work correctly when fish is running in a Chrome OS Crostini Linux VM ([#7789](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7789)).\r\n* The history file can be made a symbolic link without it being overwritten ([#7754](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7754)), matching a similar improvement for the universal variable file in 3.2.0.\r\n* An unhelpful error (\"access: No error\"), seen on Cygwin, is no longer produced ([#7785](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7785)).\r\n* Improvements to the `rsync` completions ([#7763](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7763)), some completion descriptions ([#7788](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7788)), and completions that use IP address ([#7787](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7787)).\r\n* Improvements to the appearance of `fish_config` ([#7811](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7811)).\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading from version 3.1.2 or before, please also review the release notes for 3.2.0 (included below).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDownload links: To download the source code for fish, use the file named \"fish-3.2.1.tar.xz\".

        "body": "### Notable improvements and fixes\r\n* **Undo and redo support** for the command-line editor and pager search ([#1367](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1367)). By default, undo is bound to Control+Z, and redo to Alt+/.\r\n* **Builtins can now output before all data is read**. For example, `string replace` no longer has to read all of stdin before it can begin to output. This makes it usable also for pipes where the previous command hasn't finished yet, like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Show all dmesg lines related to \"usb\"\r\ndmesg -w | string match '*usb*'\r\n```\r\n* **Prompts will now be truncated** instead of replaced with `\"> \"` if they are wider than the terminal ([#904](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/904)). For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~/dev/build/fish-shell-git/src/fish-shell/build (makepkg)>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill turn into:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u2026h-shell/build (makepkg)>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is still possible to react to the `COLUMNS` variable inside the prompt to implement smarter behavior.\r\n* **fish completes ambiguous completions** after pressing `Tab` even when they have a common prefix, without the user having to press `Tab` again ([#6924](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6924)).\r\n* fish is less aggressive about resetting terminal modes, such as flow control, after every command. Although flow control remains off by default, enterprising users can now enable it with `stty` ([#2315](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2315), [#7704](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7704)).\r\n* A new **\"fish_add_path\" helper function to add paths to $PATH** without producing duplicates, to be used interactively or in `config.fish` ([#6960](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6960), [#7028](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7028)). For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfish_add_path /opt/mycoolthing/bin\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill add /opt/mycoolthing/bin to the beginning of $fish_user_path without creating duplicates, so it can be called safely from config.fish or interactively, and the path will just be there, once.\r\n* **Better errors with \"test\"** ([#6030](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6030)):\r\n\r\n```\r\n> test 1 = 2 and echo true or false\r\ntest: Expected a combining operator like '-a' at index 4\r\n1 = 2 and echo true or echo false\r\n      ^\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis includes numbering the index from 1 instead of 0, like fish lists.\r\n* **A new theme for the documentation and Web-based configuration** ([#6500](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6500), [#7371](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7371), [#7523](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7523)), matching the design on fishshell.com.\r\n* `fish --no-execute` **will no longer complain about unknown commands** or non-matching wildcards, as these could be defined differently at runtime (especially for functions). This makes it usable as a static syntax checker ([#977](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/977)).\r\n* `string match --regex` now integrates **named PCRE2 capture groups as fish variables**, allowing variables to be set directly from `string match` ([#7459](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7459)). To support this functionality, `string` is now a reserved word and can no longer be wrapped in a function.\r\n* Globs and other **expansions are limited to 512,288 results** ([#7226](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7226)). Because operating systems limit the number of arguments to commands, larger values are unlikely to work anyway, and this helps to avoid hangs.\r\n* A new **\"fish for bash users\" documentation page** gives a quick overview of the scripting differences between bash and fish ([#2382](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2382)), and the completion tutorial has also been moved out into its own document ([#6709](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6709)).\r\n\r\n### Syntax changes and new commands\r\n* Range limits in index range expansions like `$x[$start..$end]` may be omitted: `$start` and `$end` default to 1 and -1 (the last item) respectively ([#6574](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6574)):\r\n\r\n```\r\necho $var[1..]\r\necho $var[..-1]\r\necho $var[..]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll print the full list `$var`.\r\n* When globbing, a segment which is exactly `**` may now match zero directories. For example `**/foo` may match `foo` in the current directory ([#7222](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7222)).\r\n\r\n### Scripting improvements\r\n* The `type`, `_` (gettext), `.` (source) and `:` (no-op) functions\r\nare now implemented builtins for performance purposes ([#7342](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7342), [#7036](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7036), [#6854](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6854)).\r\n* `set` and backgrounded jobs no longer overwrite `$pipestatus` ([#6820](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6820)), improving its use in command substitutions ([#6998](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6998)).\r\n* Computed (\"electric\") variables such as `status` are now only global in scope, so `set -Uq status` returns false ([#7032](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7032)).\r\n* The output for `set --show` has been shortened, only mentioning the scopes in which a variable exists ([#6944](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6944)). In addition, it now shows if a variable is a path variable.\r\n* A new variable, `fish_kill_signal`, is set to the signal that terminated the last foreground job, or `0` if the job exited normally ([#6824](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6824), [#6822](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6822)).\r\n* A new subcommand, `string pad`, allows extending strings to a given width ([#7340](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7340), [#7102](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7102)).\r\n* `string sub` has a new `--end` option to specify the end index of\r\na substring ([#6765](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6765), [#5974](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5974)).\r\n* `string split` has a new `--fields` option to specify fields to\r\noutput, similar to `cut -f` ([#6770](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6770)).\r\n* `string trim` now also trims vertical tabs by default ([#6795](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6795)).\r\n* `string replace` no longer prints an error if a capturing group wasn't matched, instead treating it as empty ([#7343](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7343)).\r\n* `string` subcommands now quit early when used with `--quiet` ([#7495](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7495)).\r\n* `string repeat` now handles multiple arguments, repeating each one ([#5988](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5988)).\r\n* `printf` no longer prints an error if not given an argument (not\r\neven a format string).\r\n* The `true` and `false` builtins ignore any arguments, like other shells ([#7030](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7030)).\r\n* `fish_indent` now removes unnecessary quotes in simple cases ([#6722](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6722))\r\nand gained a `--check` option to just check if a file is indented correctly ([#7251](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7251)).\r\n* `fish_indent` indents continuation lines that follow a line ending in a backslash, `|`, `&&` or `||`.\r\n* `pushd` only adds a directory to the stack if changing to it was successful ([#6947](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6947)).\r\n* A new `fish_job_summary` function is called whenever a background job stops or ends, or any job terminates from a signal ([#6959](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6959), [#2727](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2727), [#4319](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4319)).\r\nThe default behaviour can now be customized by redefining it.\r\n* `status` gained new `dirname` and `basename` convenience subcommands to get just the directory to the running script or the name of it, to simplify common tasks such as running `(dirname (status filename))` ([#7076](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7076), [#1818](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1818)).\r\n* Broken pipelines are now handled more smoothly; in particular, bad redirection mid-pipeline results in the job continuing to run but with the broken file descriptor replaced with a closed file descriptor. This allows better error recovery and is more in line with other shells' behaviour ([#7038](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7038)).\r\n* `jobs --quiet PID` no longer prints \"no suitable job\" if the job for PID does not exist (eg\u00a0because it has finished) ([#6809](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6809), [#6812](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6812)).\r\n* `jobs` now shows continued child processes correctly ([#6818](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6818))\r\n* `disown` should no longer create zombie processes when job control is off, such as in `config.fish` ([#7183](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7183)).\r\n* `command`, `jobs` and `type` builtins support `--query` as the long form of `-q`, matching other builtins.\r\nThe long form `--quiet` is deprecated ([#7276](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7276)).\r\n* `argparse` no longer requires a short flag letter for long-only options ([#7585](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7585))\r\nand only prints a backtrace with invalid options to argparse itself ([#6703](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6703)).\r\n* `argparse` now passes the validation variables (e.g. `$_flag_value`) as local-exported variables,\r\navoiding the need for `--no-scope-shadowing` in validation functions.\r\n* `complete` takes the first argument as the name of the command if the `--command`/`-c` option is not used,\r\nso `complete git` is treated like `complete --command git`,\r\nand it can show the loaded completions for specific commands with `complete COMMANDNAME` ([#7321](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7321)).\r\n* `set_color -b` (without an argument) no longer prints an error message, matching other invalid invocations of this command ([#7154](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7154)).\r\n* `exec` no longer produces a syntax error when the command cannot be found ([#6098](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6098)).\r\n* `set --erase` and `abbr --erase` can now erase multiple things in one go, matching `functions --erase` ([#7377](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7377)).\r\n* `abbr --erase` no longer prints errors when used with no arguments or on an unset abbreviation ([#7376](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7376), [#7732](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7732)).\r\n* `test -t`, for testing whether file descriptors are connected to a terminal, works for file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 ([#4766](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4766)).\r\nIt can still return incorrect results in other cases ([#1228](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1228)).\r\n* Trying to execute scripts with Windows line endings (CRLF) produces a sensible error ([#2783](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2783)).\r\n* Trying to execute commands with arguments that exceed the operating system limit now produces a specific error ([#6800](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6800)).\r\n* An `alias` that delegates to a command with the same name no longer triggers an error about recursive completion ([#7389](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7389)).\r\n* `math` now has a `--base` option to output the result in hexadecimal or octal ([#7496](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7496)) and produces more specific error messages ([#7508](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7508)).\r\n* `math` learned bitwise functions `bitand`, `bitor` and `bitxor`, used like `math \"bitand(0xFE, 5)\"` ([#7281](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7281)).\r\n* `math` learned tau for those who don't like typing \"2 \\* pi\".\r\n* Failed redirections will now set `$status` ([#7540](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7540)).\r\n* fish sets exit status in a more consistent manner after errors, including invalid expansions like `$foo[`.\r\n* Using `read --silent` while fish is in private mode was adding these potentially-sensitive entries to the history; this has been fixed ([#7230](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7230)).\r\n* `read` can now read interactively from other files, and can be used to read from the terminal via `read </dev/tty` (if the operating system provides `/dev/tty`) ([#7358](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7358)).\r\n* A new `fish_status_to_signal` function for transforming exit statuses to signal names has been added ([#7597](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7597), [#7595](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7595)).\r\n* The fallback `realpath` builtin supports the `-s`/`--no-symlinks` option, like GNU realpath ([#7574](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7574)).\r\n* `functions` and `type` now explain when a function was defined via `source` instead of just saying `Defined in -`.\r\n* Significant performance improvements when globbing, appending to variables or in `math`.\r\n* `echo` no longer interprets options at the beginning of an argument (eg `echo \"-n foo\"`) ([#7614](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7614)).\r\n* fish now finds user configuration even if the `HOME` environment variable is not set ([#7620](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7620)).\r\n* fish no longer crashes when started from a Windows-style working directory (eg `F:\\\\path`) ([#7636](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7636)).\r\n* `fish -c` now reads the remaining arguments into `$argv` ([#2314](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2314)).\r\n* The `pwd` command supports the long options `--logical` and `--physical`, matching other implementations ([#6787](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6787)).\r\n* `fish --profile` now only starts profiling after fish is ready to execute commands (all configuration is completed). There is a new `--profile-startup` option that only profiles the startup and configuration process ([#7648](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7648)).\r\n* Builtins return a maximum exit status of 255, rather than potentially overflowing. In particular, this affects `exit`, `return`, `functions --query`, and `set --query` ([#7698](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7698), [#7702](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7702)).\r\n* It is no longer an error to run builtin with closed stdin. For example `count <&-` now prints 0, instead of failing.\r\n* Blocks, functions, and builtins no longer permit redirecting to file descriptors other than 0 (standard input), 1 (standard output) and 2 (standard error). For example, `echo hello >&5` is now an error. This prevents corruption of internal state (#3303).\r\n\r\n### Interactive improvements\r\n* fish will now always attempt to become process group leader in interactive mode ([#7060](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7060)). This helps avoid hangs in certain circumstances, and allows tmux's current directory introspection to work ([#5699](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5699)).\r\n* The interactive reader now allows ending a line in a logical operators (`&&` and `||`) instead of complaining about a missing command. (This was already syntactically valid, but interactive sessions didn't know about it yet).\r\n* The prompt is reprinted after a background job exits ([#1018](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1018)).\r\n* fish no longer inserts a space after a completion ending in `.`, `,` or `-` is accepted, improving completions for tools that provide dynamic completions ([#6928](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6928)).\r\n* If a filename is invalid when first pressing `Tab`, but becomes valid, it will be completed properly on the next attempt ([#6863](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6863)).\r\n* `help string match/replace/<subcommand>` will show the help for string subcommands ([#6786](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6786)).\r\n* `fish_key_reader` sets the exit status to 0 when used with `--help` or `--version` ([#6964](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6964)).\r\n* `fish_key_reader` and `fish_indent` send output from `--version` to standard output, matching other fish binaries ([#6964](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6964)).\r\n* A new variable `$status_generation` is incremented only when the previous command produces an exit status ([#6815](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6815)). This can be used, for example, to check whether a failure status is a holdover due to a background job, or actually produced by the last run command.\r\n* `fish_greeting` is now a function that reads a variable of the same name, and defaults to setting it globally. This removes a universal variable by default and helps with updating the greeting. However, to disable the greeting it is now necessary to explicitly specify universal scope (`set -U fish_greeting`) or to disable it in config.fish ([#7265](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7265)).\r\n* Events are properly emitted after a job is cancelled ([#2356](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2356)).\r\n* `fish_preexec` and `fish_postexec` events are no longer triggered for empty commands ([#4829](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4829), [#7085](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7085)).\r\n* Functions triggered by the `fish_exit` event are correctly run when the terminal is closed or the shell receives SIGHUP ([#7014](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7014)).\r\n* The `fish_prompt` event no longer fires when `read` is used. If you need a function to run any time `read` is invoked by a script, use the new `fish_read` event instead ([#7039](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7039)).\r\n* A new `fish_posterror` event is emitted when attempting to execute a command with syntax errors ([#6880](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6880), [#6816](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6816)).\r\n* The debugging system has now fully switched from the old numbered level to the new named category system introduced in 3.1. A number of new debugging categories have been added, including `config`, `path`, `reader` and `screen` ([#6511](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6511)). See the output of `fish --print-debug-categories` for the full list.\r\n* The warning about read-only filesystems has been moved to a new \"warning-path\" debug category and can be disabled by setting a debug category of `-warning-path` ([#6630](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6630)):\r\n\r\n```\r\nfish --debug=-warning-path\r\n```\r\n* The enabled debug categories are now printed on shell startup ([#7007](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7007)).\r\n* The `-o` short option to fish, for `--debug-output`, works correctly instead of producing an invalid option error ([#7254](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7254)).\r\n* fish's debugging can now also be enabled via `FISH_DEBUG` and `FISH_DEBUG_OUTPUT` environment variables. This helps with debugging when no commandline options can be passed, like when fish is called in a shebang ([#7359](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7359)).\r\n* Abbreviations are now expanded after all command terminators (eg `;` or `|`), not just space, as in fish 2.7.1 and before ([#6970](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6970)), and after closing a command substitution ([#6658](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6658)).\r\n* The history file is now created with user-private permissions, matching other shells ([#6926](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6926)). The directory containing the history file was already private, so there should not have been any private data revealed.\r\n* The output of `time` is now properly aligned in all cases ([#6726](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6726), [#6714](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6714)) and no longer depends on locale ([#6757](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6757)).\r\n* The command-not-found handling has been simplified. When it can't find a command, fish now just executes a function called `fish_command_not_found` instead of firing an event, making it easier to replace and reason about. Previously-defined `__fish_command_not_found_handler` functions with an appropriate event listener will still work ([#7293](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7293)).\r\n* `Control-C` handling has been reimplemented in C++ and is therefore quicker ([#5259](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5259)), no longer occasionally prints an \"unknown command\" error ([#7145](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7145)) or overwrites multiline prompts ([#3537](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3537)).\r\n* `Control-C` no longer kills background jobs for which job control is\r\ndisabled, matching POSIX semantics ([#6828](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6828), [#6861](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6861)).\r\n* Autosuggestions work properly after `Control-C` cancels the current commmand line ([#6937](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6937)).\r\n* History search is now case-insensitive unless the search string contains an uppercase character ([#7273](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7273)).\r\n* `fish_update_completions` gained a new `--keep` option, which improves speed by skipping completions that already exist ([#6775](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6775), [#6796](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6796)).\r\n* Aliases containing an embedded backslash appear properly in the output of `alias` ([#6910](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6910)).\r\n* `open` no longer hangs indefinitely on certain systems, as a bug in `xdg-open` has been worked around ([#7215](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7215)).\r\n* Long command lines no longer add a blank line after execution ([#6826](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6826)) and behave better with `Backspace` ([#6951](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6951)).\r\n* `functions -t` works like the long option `--handlers-type`, as documented, instead of producing an error ([#6985](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6985)).\r\n* History search now flashes when it found no more results ([#7362](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7362))\r\n* fish now creates the path in the environment variable `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` if it does not exist, before using it for runtime data storage ([#7335](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7335)).\r\n* `set_color --print-colors` now also respects the bold, dim, underline, reverse, italic and background modifiers, to better show their effect ([#7314](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7314)).\r\n* The fish Web configuration tool (`fish_config`) shows prompts correctly on Termux for Android ([#7298](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7298)) and detects Windows Services for Linux 2 properly ([#7027](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7027)). It no longer shows the `history` variable as it may be too large (one can use the History tab instead). It also starts the browser in another thread, avoiding hangs in some circumstances, especially with Firefox's Developer Edition ([#7158](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7158)). Finally, a bug in the Source Code Pro font may cause browsers to hang, so this font is no longer chosen by default ([#7714](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7714)).\r\n* `funcsave` gained a new `--directory` option to specify the location of the saved function ([#7041](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7041)).\r\n* `help` works properly on MSYS2 ([#7113](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7113)) and only uses `cmd.exe` if running on WSL ([#6797](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6797)).\r\n* Resuming a piped job by its number, like `fg %1`, works correctly ([#7406](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7406)). Resumed jobs show the correct title in the terminal emulator ([#7444](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7444)).\r\n* Commands run from key bindings now use the same TTY modes as normal commands ([#7483](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7483)).\r\n* Autosuggestions from history are now case-sensitive ([#3978](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3978)).\r\n* `$status` from completion scripts is no longer passed outside the completion, which keeps the status display in the prompt as the last command's status ([#7555](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7555)).\r\n* Updated localisations for pt_BR ([#7480](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7480)).\r\n* `fish_trace` output now starts with `->` (like `fish --profile`), making the depth more visible ([#7538](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7538)).\r\n* Resizing the terminal window no longer produces a corrupted prompt ([#6532](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6532), [#7404](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7404)).\r\n* `functions` produces an error rather than crashing on certain invalid arguments ([#7515](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7515)).\r\n* A crash in completions with inline variable assignment (eg `A= b`) has been fixed ([#7344](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7344)).\r\n* `fish_private_mode` may now be changed dynamically using `set` ([#7589](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7589)), and history is kept in memory in private mode (but not stored permanently) ([#7590](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7590)).\r\n* Commands with leading spaces may be retrieved from history with up-arrow until a new command is run, matching zsh's `HIST_IGNORE_SPACE` ([#1383](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1383)).\r\n* Importing bash history or reporting errors with recursive globs (`\\*\\*`) no longer hangs ([#7407](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7407), [#7497](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7497)).\r\n* `bind` now shows `\\\\x7f` for the del key instead of a literal DEL character ([#7631](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7631))\r\n* Paths containing variables or tilde expansion are only suggested when they are still valid ([#7582](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7582)).\r\n* Syntax highlighting can now color a command as invalid even if executed quickly ([#5912](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5912)).\r\n* Redirection targets are no longer highlighted as error if they contain variables which will likely be defined by the current commandline ([#6654](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6654)).\r\n* fish is now more resilient against broken terminal modes ([#7133](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7133), [#4873](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4873)).\r\n* fish handles being in control of the TTY without owning its own process group better, avoiding some hangs in special configurations ([#7388](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7388)).\r\n* Keywords can now be colored differently by setting the `fish_color_keyword` variable (`fish_color_command` is used as a fallback) ([#7678](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7678)).\r\n* Just like `fish_indent`, the interactive reader will indent continuation lines that follow a line ending in a backslash, `|`, `&&` or `||` ([#7694](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7694)).\r\n* Commands with a trailing escaped space are saved in history correctly ([#7661](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7661)).\r\n* `fish_prompt` no longer mangles Unicode characters in the private-use range U+F600-U+F700. ([#7723](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7723)).\r\n* The universal variable file, `fish_variables`, can be made a symbolic link without it being overwritten ([#7466](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7466)).\r\n* fish is now more resilient against `mktemp` failing ([#7482](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7482)).\r\n\r\n#### New or improved bindings\r\n* As mentioned above, new special input functions `undo` (`Control+_` or `Control+Z`) and `redo` (`Alt-/`) can be used to revert changes to the command line or the pager search field ([#6570](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6570)).\r\n* `Control-Z` is now available for binding ([#7152](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7152)).\r\n* Additionally, using the `cancel` special input function (bound to `Escape` by default) right after fish picked an unambiguous completion will undo that ([#7433](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7433)).\r\n* `fish_clipboard_paste` (`Control+V`) trims indentation from multiline commands, because fish already indents ([#7662](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7662)).\r\n* Vi mode bindings now support `dh`, `dl`, `c0`, `cf`, `ct`, `cF`, `cT`, `ch`, `cl`, `y0`, `ci`, `ca`, `yi`, `ya`, `di`, `da`, `d;`, `d,`, `o`, `O` and Control+left/right keys to navigate by word ([#6648](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6648), [#6755](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6755), [#6769](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6769), [#7442](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7442), [#7516](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7516)).\r\n* Vi mode bindings support `~` (tilde) to toggle the case of the selected character ([#6908](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6908)).\r\n* Functions `up-or-search` and `down-or-search` (`Up` and `Down`) can cross empty lines, and don't activate search mode if the search fails, which makes them easier to use to move between lines in some situations.\r\n* If history search fails to find a match, the cursor is no longer moved. This is useful when accidentally starting a history search on a multi-line commandline.\r\n* The special input function `beginning-of-history` (`Page Up`) now moves to the oldest search instead of the youngest - that's `end-of-history` (`Page Down`).\r\n* A new special input function `forward-single-char` moves one character to the right, and if an autosuggestion is available, only take a single character from it ([#7217](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7217), [#4984](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4984)).\r\n* Special input functions can now be joined with `or` as a modifier (adding to `and`), though only some commands set an exit status ([#7217](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7217)). This includes `suppress-autosuggestion` to reflect whether an autosuggestion was suppressed ([#1419](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1419))\r\n* A new function `__fish_preview_current_file`, bound to `Alt+O`, opens the\r\ncurrent file at the cursor in a pager ([#6838](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6838), [#6855](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6855)).\r\n* `edit_command_buffer` (`Alt-E` and `Alt-V`) passes the cursor position\r\nto the external editor if the editor is recognized ([#6138](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6138), [#6954](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6954)).\r\n* `__fish_prepend_sudo` (`Alt-S`) now toggles a `sudo` prefix ([#7012](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7012)) and avoids shifting the cursor ([#6542](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6542)).\r\n* `__fish_prepend_sudo` (`Alt-S`) now uses the previous commandline if the current one is empty, to simplify rerunning the previous command with `sudo` ([#7079](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7079)).\r\n* `__fish_toggle_comment_commandline` (`Alt-#`) now uncomments and presents the last comment from history if the commandline is empty ([#7137](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7137)).\r\n* `__fish_whatis_current_token` (`Alt-W`) prints descriptions for functions and builtins ([#7191](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7191), [#2083](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2083)).\r\n* The definition of \"word\" and \"bigword\" for movements was refined, fixing (eg) vi mode's behavior with `e` on the second-to-last char, and bigword's behavior with single-character words and non-blank non-graphical characters ([#7353](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7353), [#7354](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7354), [#4025](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4025), [#7328](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7328), [#7325](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7325))\r\n* fish's clipboard bindings now also support Windows Subsystem for Linux via PowerShell and clip.exe ([#7455](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7455), [#7458](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7458)) and will properly copy newlines in multi-line commands.\r\n* Using the `\\*-jump` special input functions before typing anything else no longer crashes fish.\r\n* Completing variable overrides (`foo=bar`) could replace the entire thing with just the completion in some circumstances. This has been fixed ([#7398](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7398)).\r\n\r\n#### Improved prompts\r\n* The default and example prompts print the correct exit status for commands prefixed with `not` ([#6566](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6566)).\r\n* git prompts include all untracked files in the repository, not just those in the current directory ([#6086](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6086)).\r\n* The git prompts correctly show stash states ([#6876](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6876), [#7136](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7136)) and clean states ([#7471](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7471)).\r\n* The Mercurial prompt correctly shows untracked status ([#6906](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6906)), and by default only shows the branch for performance reasons.\r\nA new variable `$fish_prompt_hg_show_informative_status` can be set to enable more information.\r\n* The `fish_vcs_prompt` passes its arguments to the various VCS prompts that it calls ([#7033](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7033)).\r\n* The Subversion prompt was broken in a number of ways in 3.1.0 and has been restored ([#6715](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6715), [#7278](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7278)).\r\n* A new helper function `fish_is_root_user` simplifies checking for superuser privilege ([#7031](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7031), [#7123](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7123)).\r\n* New colorschemes - `ayu Light`, `ayu Dark` and `ayu Mirage` ([#7596](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7596)).\r\n* Bugs related to multiline prompts, including repainting ([#5860](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5860)) or navigating directory history ([#3550](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3550)) leading to graphical glitches have been fixed.\r\n* The `nim` prompt now handles vi mode better ([#6802](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6802))\r\n\r\n#### Improved terminal support\r\n* A new variable, `fish_vi_force_cursor`, can be set to force `fish_vi_cursor` to attempt changing the cursor\r\nshape in vi mode, regardless of terminal ([#6968](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6968)). The `fish_vi_cursor` option `--force-iterm` has been deprecated.\r\n* `diff` will now colourize output, if supported ([#7308](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7308)).\r\n* Autosuggestions appear when the cursor passes the right prompt ([#6948](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6948)) or wraps to the next line ([#7213](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7213)).\r\n* The cursor shape in Vi mode changes properly in Windows Terminal ([#6999](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6999), [#6478](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6478)).\r\n* The spurious warning about terminal size in small terminals has been removed ([#6980](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6980)).\r\n* Dynamic titles are now enabled in Alacritty ([#7073](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7073)) and emacs' vterm ([#7122](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7122)).\r\n* Current working directory updates are enabled in foot ([#7099](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7099)) and WezTerm ([#7649](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7649)).\r\n* The width computation for certain emoji agrees better with terminals (especially flags). ([#7237](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7237)).\r\n* Long command lines are wrapped in all cases, instead of sometimes being put on a new line ([#5118](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5118)).\r\n* The pager is properly rendered with long command lines selected ([#2557](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2557)).\r\n* Sessions with right prompts can be resized correctly in terminals that handle reflow, like GNOME Terminal (and other VTE-based terminals), upcoming Konsole releases and Alacritty. This detection can be overridden with the new `fish_handle_reflow` variable ([#7491](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7491)).\r\n* fish now sets terminal modes sooner, which stops output from appearing before the greeting and prompt are ready ([#7489](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7489)).\r\n* Better detection of new Konsole versions for true color support and cursor shape changing.\r\n* fish no longer attempts to modify the terminal size via `TIOCSWINSZ`, improving compatibility with Kitty ([#6994](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6994)).\r\n\r\n#### Completions\r\n* Added completions for\r\n    * `7z`, `7za` and `7zr`

like `from..to` or `left...right`.\r\n    * Completion scripts for custom Git subcommands like `git-xyz` are now loaded with Git completions. The completions can now be defined directly on the subcommand (using `complete git-xyz`), and completion for `git xyz` will work. ([#7075](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7075), [#7652](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7652), [#4358](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4358))\r\n    * `make` completions no longer second-guess make's file detection, fixing target completion in some cases ([#7535](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7535)).\r\n    * Command completions now correctly print the description even if the command was fully matched (like in `ls<TAB>`).\r\n    * `set` completions no longer hide variables starting with `__`, they are sorted last instead.\r\n* Improvements to the manual page completion generator ([#7086](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7086), [#6879](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6879), [#7187](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7187)).\r\n* Significant performance improvements to completion of the available commands ([#7153](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7153)), especially on macOS Big Sur where there was a significant regression ([#7365](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7365), [#7511](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7511)).\r\n* Suffix completion using `__fish_complete_suffix` uses the same fuzzy matching logic as normal file completion, and completes any file but sorts files with matching suffix first ([#7040](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7040), [#7547](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7547)). Previously, it only completed files with matching suffix.\r\n\r\n### For distributors\r\n* fish has a new interactive test driver based on pexpect, removing the optional dependency on expect (and adding an optional dependency on pexpect) ([#5451](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5451), [#6825](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6825)).\r\n* The CHANGELOG was moved to restructured text, allowing it to be included in the documentation ([#7057](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7057)).\r\n* fish handles ncurses installed in a non-standard prefix better ([#6600](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6600), [#7219](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7219)), and uses variadic tparm on NetBSD curses ([#6626](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6626)).\r\n* The Web-based configuration tool no longer uses an obsolete Angular version ([#7147](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7147)).\r\n* The fish project has adopted the Contributor Covenant code of conduct ([#7151](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7151)).\r\n\r\n### Deprecations and removed features\r\n* The `fish_color_match` variable is no longer used. (Previously this controlled the color of matching quotes and parens when using `read`).\r\n* fish 3.2.0 will be the last release in which the redirection to standard error with the `^` character is enabled. The `stderr-nocaret` feature flag will be changed to \"on\" in future releases.\r\n* `string` is now a reserved word and cannot be used for function names (see above).\r\n* `fish_vi_cursor`'s option `--force-iterm` has been deprecated (see above).\r\n* `command`, `jobs` and `type` long-form option `--quiet` is deprecated in favor of `--query` (see above).\r\n* The `fish_command_not_found` event is no longer emitted, instead there is a function of that name. By default it will call a previously-defined `__fish_command_not_found_handler`. To emit the event manually use `emit fish_command_not_found`.\r\n* The `fish_prompt` event no longer fires when `read` is used. If you need a function to run any time `read` is invoked by a script, use the new `fish_read` event instead ([#7039](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7039)).\r\n* To disable the greeting message permanently it is no longer enough to just run `set fish_greeting` interactively as it is no longer implicitly a universal variable. Use `set -U fish_greeting` or disable it in config.fish with `set -g fish_greeting`.\r\n* The long-deprecated and non-functional `-m`/`--read-mode` options to `read` were removed in 3.1b1. Using the short form, or a never-implemented `-B` option, no longer crashes fish ([#7659](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7659)).\r\n* With the addition of new categories for debug options, the old numbered debugging levels have been removed.\r\n\r\n### For distributors and developers\r\n* fish source tarballs are now distributed using the XZ compression\r\nmethod ([#5460](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5460)).\r\n* The fish source tarball contains an example FreeDesktop entry and icon.\r\n* The CMake variable `MAC_CODESIGN_ID` can now be set to \"off\" to disable code-signing ([#6952](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6952), [#6792](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6792)).\r\n* Building on on macOS earlier than 10.13.6 succeeds, instead of failing on code-signing ([#6791](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6791)).\r\n* The pkg-config file now uses variables to ensure paths used are portable across prefixes.\r\n* The default values for the `extra_completionsdir`, `extra_functionsdir` and `extra_confdir` options now use the installation prefix rather than `/usr/local` ([#6778](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6778)).\r\n* A new CMake variable `FISH_USE_SYSTEM_PCRE2` controls whether fish builds with the system-installed PCRE2, or the version it bundles. By default it prefers the system library if available, unless Mac codesigning is enabled ([#6952](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6952)).\r\n* Running the full interactive test suite now requires Python 3.5+ and the pexpect package ([#6825](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6825)); the expect package is no longer required.\r\n* Support for Python 2 in fish's tools (`fish_config` and the manual page completion generator) is no longer guaranteed. Please use Python 3.5 or later ([#6537](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6537)).\r\n* The Web-based configuration tool is compatible with Python 3.10  ([#7600](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7600)) and no longer requires Python's distutils package ([#7514](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7514)).\r\n* fish 3.2 is the last release to support Red Hat Enterprise Linux & CentOS version 6.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nDownload links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-3.2.0.tar.xz\".

These handlers have never worked in non-interactive sessions, and making them work is an ongoing process.\r\n- Functions using `--on-variable` work reliably with variables which are set implicitly (rather than with `set`), such as \"`fish_bind_mode`\" and \"`PWD`\" (#6653).\r\n- 256 colors are properly enabled under certain conditions that were incorrectly detected in fish 3.1.0 (`$TERM` begins with xterm, does not include \"`256color`\", and `$TERM_PROGRAM` is not set) (#6701).\r\n- The Mercurial (`hg`) prompt no longer produces an error when the current working directory is removed (#6699). Also, for performance reasons it shows only basic information by default; to restore the detailed status, set `$fish_prompt_hg_show_informative_status`.\r\n- The VCS prompt, `fish_vcs_prompt`, no longer displays Subversion (`svn`) status by default, due to the potential slowness of this operation (#6681).\r\n- Pasting of commands has been sped up (#6713).\r\n- Using extended Unicode characters, such as emoji, in a non-Unicode capable locale (such as the `C` or `POSIX` locale) no longer renders all output blank (#6736).\r\n- `help` prefers to use `xdg-open`, avoiding the use of `open` on Debian systems where this command is actually `openvt` (#6739).\r\n- Command lines starting with a space, which are not saved in history, now do not get autosuggestions. This fixes an issue with Midnight Commander integration (#6763), but may be changed in a future version.\r\n- Copying to the clipboard no longer inserts a newline at the end of the content, matching fish 2.7 and earlier (#6927).\r\n- `fzf` in complex pipes no longer hangs. More generally, code run as part of command substitutions or `eval` will no longer have separate process groups. (#6624, #6806).\r\n\r\nThis release also includes:\r\n- a number of changes to improve macOS compatibility with code signing and notarization;\r\n- a number of improvements to completions; and\r\n- a number of content and formatting improvements to the documentation.\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading from version 3.0.0 or before, please also review the release notes for 3.1.0 and 3.1b1.\r\n\r\n## Errata for fish 3.1\r\n\r\nA new builtin, `time`, was introduced in the fish 3.1 releases. This builtin is a reserved word (like `test`, `function`, and others) because of the way it is implemented, and functions can no longer be named `time`. This was not clear in the fish 3.1b1 release notes.",

A GPG signature from David Adam (0x7A67D962D88A709A) is available as \"`fish-3.1.0.tar.gz.asc`\".*\r\n\r\nCompared to the beta release of fish 3.1b1, fish version 3.1.0:\r\n- fixes a regression where spaces after a brace were removed despite brace expansion not occurring (#6564)\r\n- fixes a number of problems in compiling and testing on Cygwin (#6549) and Solaris-derived systems such as Illumos (#6553, #6554, #6555, #6556, and #6558); \r\n- fixes the process for building macOS packages; and\r\n- contains some improvements to the documentation and a small number of completions.\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading from version 3.0.0 or before, please also review the release notes for 3.1b1 (included below).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# fish 3.1b1 (released January 26, 2020)\r\n\r\n## Notable improvements and fixes\r\n- A new `$pipestatus` variable contains a list of exit statuses of the previous job, for each of the separate commands in a pipeline (#5632).\r\n- fish no longer buffers pipes to the last function in a pipeline, improving many cases where pipes appeared to block or hang (#1396).\r\n- An overhaul of error messages for builtin commands, including a removal of the overwhelming usage summary, more readable stack traces (#3404, #5434), and stack traces for `test` (aka `[`) (#5771).\r\n- fish's debugging arguments have been significantly improved. The `--debug-level` option has been removed, and a new `--debug` option replaces it. This option accepts various categories, which may be listed via `fish --print-debug-categories` (#5879). A new `--debug-output` option allows for redirection of debug output.\r\n- `string` has a new `collect` subcommand for use in command substitutions, producing a single output instead of splitting on new lines (similar to `\"$(cmd)\"` in other shells) (#159).\r\n- The fish manual, tutorial and FAQ are now available in `man` format as `fish-doc`, `fish-tutorial` and `fish-faq` respectively (#5521).\r\n- Like other shells, `cd` now always looks for its argument in the current directory as a last resort, even if the `CDPATH` variable does not include it or \".\" (#4484).\r\n- fish now correctly handles `CDPATH` entries that start with `..` (#6220) or contain `./` (#5887).\r\n- The `fish_trace` variable may be set to trace execution (#3427). This performs a similar role as `set -x` in other shells.\r\n- fish uses the temporary directory determined by the system, rather than relying on `/tmp` (#3845).\r\n- The fish Web configuration tool (`fish_config`) prints a list of commands it is executing, to help understanding and debugging (#5584).\r\n- Major performance improvements when pasting (#5866), executing lots of commands (#5905), importing history from bash (#6295), and when completing variables that might match `$history` (#6288).\r\n\r\n### Syntax changes and new commands\r\n- A new builtin command, `time`, which allows timing of fish functions and builtins as well as external commands (#117).\r\n- Brace expansion now only takes place if the braces include a \",\" or a variable expansion, meaning common commands such as `git reset HEAD@{0}` do not require escaping (#5869).\r\n- New redirections `&>` and `&|` may be used to redirect or pipe stdout, and also redirect stderr to stdout (#6192).\r\n- `switch` now allows arguments that expand to nothing, like empty variables (#5677).\r\n- The `VAR=val cmd` syntax can now be used to run a command in a modified environment (#6287).\r\n- `and` is no longer recognised as a command, so that nonsensical constructs like `and and and` produce a syntax error (#6089).\r\n- `math`'s exponent operator, '`^`', was previously left-associative, but now uses the more commonly-used right-associative behaviour (#6280). This means that `math '3^0.5^2'` was previously calculated as '(3^0.5)^2', but is now calculated as '3^(0.5^2)'.\r\n- In fish 3.0, the variable used with `for` loops inside command substitutions could leak into enclosing scopes; this was an inadvertent behaviour change and has been reverted (#6480).\r\n\r\n### Scripting improvements\r\n- `string split0` now returns 0 if it split something (#5701).\r\n- In the interest of consistency, `builtin -q` and `command -q` can now be used to query if a builtin or command exists (#5631).\r\n- `math` now accepts `--scale=max` for the maximum scale (#5579).\r\n- `builtin $var` now works correctly, allowing a variable as the builtin name (#5639).\r\n- `cd` understands the `--` argument to make it possible to change to directories starting with a hyphen (#6071).\r\n- `complete --do-complete` now also does fuzzy matches (#5467).\r\n- `complete --do-complete` can be used inside completions, allowing limited recursion (#3474).\r\n- `count` now also counts lines fed on standard input (#5744).\r\n- `eval` produces an exit status of 0 when given no arguments, like other shells (#5692).\r\n- `printf` prints what it can when input hasn't been fully converted to a number, but still prints an error (#5532).\r\n- `complete -C foo` now works as expected, rather than requiring `complete -Cfoo`.\r\n- `complete` has a new `--force-files` option, to re-enable file completions. This allows `sudo -E` and `pacman -Qo` to complete correctly (#5646).\r\n- `argparse` now defaults to showing the current function name (instead of `argparse`) in its errors, making `--name` often superfluous (#5835).\r\n- `argparse` has a new `--ignore-unknown` option to keep unrecognized options, allowing multiple argparse passes to parse options (#5367).\r\n- `argparse` correctly handles flag value validation of options that only have short names (#5864).\r\n- `read -S` (short option of `--shell`) is recognised correctly (#5660).\r\n- `read` understands `--list`, which acts like `--array` in reading all arguments into a list inside a single variable, but is better named (#5846).\r\n- `read` has a new option, `--tokenize`, which splits a string into variables according to the shell's tokenization rules, considering quoting, escaping, and so on (#3823).\r\n- `read` interacts more correctly with the deprecated `$IFS` variable, in particular removing multiple separators when splitting a variable into a list (#6406), matching other shells.\r\n- `fish_indent` now handles semicolons better, including leaving them in place for `; and` and `; or` instead of breaking the line (#5859).\r\n- `fish_indent --write` now supports multiple file arguments, indenting them in turn.\r\n- The default read limit has been increased to 100MiB (#5267).\r\n- `math` now also understands `x` for multiplication, provided it is followed by whitespace (#5906).\r\n- `math` reports the right error when incorrect syntax is used inside parentheses (#6063), and warns when unsupported logical operations are used (#6096).\r\n- `functions --erase` now also prevents fish from autoloading a function for the first time (#5951).\r\n- `jobs --last` returns 0 to indicate success when a job is found (#6104).\r\n- `commandline -p` and `commandline -j` now split on `&&` and `||` in addition to `;` and `&` (#6214).\r\n- A bug where `string split` would drop empty strings if the output was only empty strings has been fixed (#5987).\r\n- `eval` no long creates a new local variable scope, but affects variables in the scope it is called from (#4443). `source` still creates a new local scope.\r\n- `abbr` has a new `--query` option to check for the existence of an abbreviation.\r\n- Local values for `fish_complete_path` and `fish_function_path` are now ignored; only their global values are respected.\r\n- Syntax error reports now display a marker in the correct position (#5812).\r\n- Empty universal variables may now be exported (#5992).\r\n- Exported universal variables are no longer imported into the global scope, preventing shadowing. This makes it easier to change such variables for all fish sessions and avoids breakage when the value is a list of multiple elements (#5258).\r\n- A bug where `for` could use invalid variable names has been fixed (#5800).\r\n- A bug where local variables would not be exported to functions has been fixed (#6153).\r\n- The null command (`:`) now always exits successfully, rather than passing through the previous exit status (#6022).\r\n- The output of `functions FUNCTION` matches the declaration of the function, correctly including comments or blank lines (#5285), and correctly includes any `--wraps` flags (#1625).\r\n- `type` supports a new option, `--short`, which suppress function expansion (#6403).\r\n- `type --path` with a function argument will now output the path to the file containing the definition of that function, if it exists.\r\n- `type --force-path` with an argument that cannot be found now correctly outputs nothing, as documented (#6411).\r\n- The `$hostname` variable is no longer truncated to 32 characters (#5758).\r\n- Line numbers in function backtraces are calculated correctly (#6350).\r\n- A new `fish_cancel` event is emitted when the command line is cancelled, which is useful for terminal integration (#5973).\r\n\r\n### Interactive improvements\r\n- New Base16 color options are available through the Web-based configuration (#6504).\r\n- fish only parses `/etc/paths` on macOS in login shells, matching the bash implementation (#5637) and avoiding changes to path ordering in child shells (#5456). It now ignores blank lines like the bash implementation (#5809).\r\n- The locale is now reloaded when the `LOCPATH` variable is changed (#5815).\r\n- `read` no longer keeps a history, making it suitable for operations that shouldn't end up there, like password entry (#5904).\r\n- `dirh` outputs its stack in the correct order (#5477), and behaves as documented when universal variables are used for its stack (#5797).\r\n- `funced` and the edit-commandline-in-buffer bindings did not work in fish 3.0 when the `$EDITOR` variable contained spaces; this has been corrected (#5625).\r\n- Builtins now pipe their help output to a pager automatically (#6227).\r\n- `set_color` now colors the `--print-colors` output in the matching colors if it is going to a terminal.\r\n- fish now underlines every valid entered path instead of just the last one (#5872).\r\n- When syntax highlighting a string with an unclosed quote, only the quote itself will be shown as an error, instead of the whole argument.\r\n- Syntax highlighting works correctly with variables as commands (#5658) and redirections to close file descriptors (#6092).\r\n- `help` works properly on Windows Subsytem for Linux (#5759, #6338).\r\n- A bug where `disown` could crash the shell has been fixed (#5720).\r\n- fish will not autosuggest files ending with `~` unless there are no other candidates, as these are generally backup files (#985).\r\n- Escape in the pager works correctly (#5818).\r\n- Key bindings that call `fg` no longer leave the terminal in a broken state (#2114).\r\n- Brackets (#5831) and filenames containing `$` (#6060) are completed with appropriate escaping.\r\n- The output of `complete` and `functions` is now colorized in interactive terminals.\r\n- The Web-based configuration handles aliases that include single quotes correctly (#6120), and launches correctly under Termux (#6248) and OpenBSD (#6522).\r\n- `function` now correctly validates parameters for `--argument-names` as valid variable names (#6147) and correctly parses options following `--argument-names`, as in \"`--argument-names foo --description bar`\" (#6186).\r\n- History newly imported from bash includes command lines using `&&` or `||`.\r\n- The automatic generation of completions from manual pages is better described in job and process listings, and no longer produces a warning when exiting fish (#6269).\r\n- In private mode, setting `$fish_greeting` to an empty string before starting the private session will prevent the warning about history not being saved from being printed (#6299).\r\n- In the interactive editor, a line break (Enter) inside unclosed brackets will insert a new line, rather than executing the command and producing an error (#6316).\r\n- Ctrl-C always repaints the prompt (#6394).\r\n- When run interactively from another program (such as Python), fish will correctly start a new process group, like other shells (#5909).\r\n- Job identifiers (for example, for background jobs) are assigned more logically (#6053).\r\n- A bug where history would appear truncated if an empty command was executed was fixed (#6032).\r\n\r\n#### New or improved bindings\r\n- Pasting strips leading spaces to avoid pasted commands being omitted from the history (#4327).\r\n- Shift-Left and Shift-Right now default to moving backwards and forwards by one bigword (words separated by whitespace) (#1505).\r\n- The default escape delay (to differentiate between the escape key and an alt-combination) has been reduced to 30ms, down from 300ms for the default mode and 100ms for Vi mode (#3904).\r\n- The `forward-bigword` binding now interacts correctly with autosuggestions (#5336).\r\n- The `fish_clipboard_*` functions support Wayland by using [`wl-clipboard`](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard) (#5450).\r\n- The `nextd` and `prevd` functions no longer print \"Hit end of history\", instead using a bell. They correctly store working directories containing symbolic links (#6395).\r\n- If a `fish_mode_prompt` function exists, Vi mode will only execute it on mode-switch instead of the entire prompt. This should make it much more responsive with slow prompts (#5783).\r\n- The path-component bindings (like Ctrl-w) now also stop at \":\" and \"@\", because those are used to denote user and host in commands such as `ssh` (#5841).\r\n- The NULL character can now be bound via `bind -k nul`. Terminals often generate this character via control-space. (#3189).\r\n- A new readline command `expand-abbr` can be used to trigger abbreviation expansion (#5762).\r\n- A new readline command, `delete-or-exit`, removes a character to the right of the cursor or exits the shell if the command line is empty (moving this functionality out of the `delete-or-exit` function).\r\n- The `self-insert` readline command will now insert the binding sequence, if not empty.\r\n- A new binding to prepend `sudo`, bound to Alt-S by default (#6140).\r\n- The Alt-W binding to describe a command should now work better with multiline prompts (#6110)\r\n- The Alt-H binding to open a command's man page now tries to ignore `sudo` (#6122).\r\n- A new pair of bind functions, `history-prefix-search-backward` (and `forward`), was introduced (#6143).\r\n- Vi mode now supports R to enter replace mode (#6342), and `d0` to delete the current line (#6292).\r\n- In Vi mode, hitting Enter in replace-one mode no longer erases the prompt (#6298).\r\n- Selections in Vi mode are inclusive, matching the actual behaviour of Vi (#5770).\r\n\r\n#### Improved prompts\r\n- The Git prompt in informative mode now shows the number of stashes if enabled.\r\n- The Git prompt now has an option (`$__fish_git_prompt_use_informative_chars`) to use the (more modern) informative characters without enabling informative mode.\r\n- The default prompt now also features VCS integration and will color the host if running via SSH (#6375).\r\n- The default and example prompts print the pipe status if an earlier command in the pipe fails.\r\n- The default and example prompts try to resolve exit statuses to signal names when appropriate.\r\n\r\n#### Improved terminal output\r\n- New `fish_pager_color_` options have been added to control more elements of the pager's colors (#5524).\r\n- Better detection and support for using fish from various system consoles, where limited colors and special characters are supported (#5552).\r\n- fish now tries to guess if the system supports Unicode 9 (and displays emoji as wide), eliminating the need to set `$fish_emoji_width` in most cases (#5722).\r\n- Improvements to the display of wide characters, particularly Korean characters and emoji (#5583, #5729).\r\n- The Vi mode cursor is correctly redrawn when regaining focus under terminals that report focus (eg tmux) (#4788).\r\n- Variables that control background colors (such as `fish_pager_color_search_match`) can now use `--reverse`.\r\n\r\n#### Completions\r\n- Added completions for\r\n  - `aws`\r\n  - `bat` (#6052)\r\n  - `bosh` (#5700)\r\n  - `btrfs`\r\n  - `camcontrol`\r\n  - `cf` (#5700)\r\n  - `chronyc` (#6496)\r\n  - `code` (#6205)\r\n  - `cryptsetup` (#6488)\r\n  - `csc` and `csi` (#6016)\r\n  - `cwebp` (#6034)\r\n  - `cygpath` and `cygstart` (#6239)\r\n  - `epkginfo` (#5829)\r\n  - `ffmpeg`, `ffplay`, and `ffprobe` (#5922)\r\n  - `fsharpc` and `fsharpi` (#6016)\r\n  - `fzf` (#6178)\r\n  - `g++` (#6217)\r\n  - `gpg1` (#6139)\r\n  - `gpg2` (#6062)\r\n  - `grub-mkrescue` (#6182)\r\n  - `hledger` (#6043)\r\n  - `hwinfo` (#6496)\r\n  - `irb` (#6260)\r\n  - `iw` (#6232)\r\n  - `kak`\r\n  - `keepassxc-cli` (#6505)\r\n  - `keybase` (#6410)\r\n  - `loginctl` (#6501)\r\n  - `lz4`, `lz4c` and `lz4cat` (#6364)\r\n  - `mariner` (#5718)\r\n  - `nethack` (#6240)\r\n  - `patool` (#6083)\r\n  - `phpunit` (#6197)\r\n  - `plutil` (#6301)\r\n  - `pzstd` (#6364)\r\n  - `qubes-gpg-client` (#6067)\r\n  - `resolvectl` (#6501)\r\n  - `rg`\r\n  - `rustup`\r\n  - `sfdx` (#6149)\r\n  - `speedtest` and `speedtest-cli` (#5840)\r\n  - `src` (#6026)\r\n  - `tokei` (#6085)\r\n  - `tsc` (#6016)\r\n  - `unlz4` (#6364)\r\n  - `unzstd` (#6364)\r\n  - `vbc` (#6016)\r\n  - `zpaq` (#6245)\r\n  - `zstd`, `zstdcat`, `zstdgrep`, `zstdless` and `zstdmt` (#6364)\r\n- Lots of improvements to completions.\r\n- Selecting short options which also have a long name from the completion pager is possible (#5634).\r\n- Tab completion will no longer add trailing spaces if they already exist (#6107).\r\n- Completion of subcommands to builtins like `and` or `not` now works correctly (#6249).\r\n- Completion of arguments to short options works correctly when multiple short options are used together (#332).\r\n- Activating completion in the middle of an invalid completion does not move the cursor any more, making it easier to fix a mistake (#4124).\r\n- Completion in empty commandlines now lists all available commands.\r\n- Functions listed as completions could previously leak parts of the function as other completions; this has been fixed.\r\n\r\n### Deprecations and removed features\r\n- The vcs-prompt functions have been promoted to names without double-underscore, so __fish_git_prompt is now fish_git_prompt, __fish_vcs_prompt is now fish_vcs_prompt, __fish_hg_prompt is now fish_hg_prompt and __fish_svn_prompt is now fish_svn_prompt. Shims at the old names have been added, and the variables have kept their old names (#5586).\r\n- `string replace` has an additional round of escaping in the replacement expression, so escaping backslashes requires many escapes (eg `string replace -ra '([ab])' '\\\\\\\\\\\\\\$1' a`). The new feature flag `regex-easyesc` can be used to disable this, so that the same effect can be achieved with `string replace -ra '([ab])' '\\\\\\\\$1' a` (#5556). As a reminder, the intention behind feature flags is that this will eventually become the default and then only option, so scripts should be updated.\r\n- The `fish_vi_mode` function, deprecated in fish 2.3, has been removed. Use `fish_vi_key_bindings` instead (#6372).\r\n\r\n### For distributors and developers\r\n- fish 3.0 introduced a CMake-based build system. In fish 3.1, both the Autotools-based build and legacy Xcode build system have been removed, leaving only the CMake build system. All distributors and developers must install CMake.\r\n- fish now depends on the common `tee` external command, for the `psub` process substitution function.\r\n- The documentation is now built with Sphinx. The old Doxygen-based documentation system has been removed. Developers, and distributors who wish to rebuild the documentation, must install Sphinx.\r\n- The `INTERNAL_WCWIDTH` build option has been removed, as fish now always uses an internal `wcwidth` function. It has a number of configuration options that make it more suitable for general use (#5777).\r\n- mandoc can now be used to format the output from `--help` if `nroff` is not installed, reducing the number of external dependencies on systems with `mandoc` installed (#5489).\r\n- Some bugs preventing building on Solaris-derived systems such as Illumos were fixed (#5458, #5461, #5611).\r\n- Completions for `npm`, `bower` and `yarn` no longer require the `jq` utility for full functionality, but will use Python instead if it is available.\r\n- The paths for completions, functions and configuration snippets have been extended. On systems that define `XDG_DATA_DIRS`, each of the directories in this variable are searched in the subdirectories `fish/vendor_completions.d`, `fish/vendor_functions.d`, and `fish/vendor_conf.d` respectively. On systems that do not define this variable in the environment, the vendor directories are searched for in both the installation prefix and the default \"extra\" directory, which now defaults to `/usr/local` (#5029).",

        "body": "*Download links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-3.1b1.tar.gz\". The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" will not build correctly. The SHA-256 sum of this file is `7847cb2777cc6ea2a18f147a0e567de5bdac4febf6afdfcf867eb45501183a1a`. A GPG signature from David Adam (0x7A67D962D88A709A)  is available as \"fish-3.1b1.tar.gz.asc\".*\r\n\r\n## Notable improvements and fixes\r\n- A new `$pipestatus` variable contains a list of exit statuses of the previous job, for each of the separate commands in a pipeline (#5632).\r\n- fish no longer buffers pipes to the last function in a pipeline, improving many cases where pipes appeared to block or hang (#1396).\r\n- An overhaul of error messages for builtin commands, including a removal of the overwhelming usage summary, more readable stack traces (#3404, #5434), and stack traces for `test` (aka `[`) (#5771).\r\n- fish's debugging arguments have been significantly improved. The `--debug-level` option has been removed, and a new `--debug` option replaces it. This option accepts various categories, which may be listed via `fish --print-debug-categories` (#5879). A new `--debug-output` option allows for redirection of debug output.\r\n- `string` has a new `collect` subcommand for use in command substitutions, producing a single output instead of splitting on new lines (similar to `\"$(cmd)\"` in other shells) (#159).\r\n- The fish manual, tutorial and FAQ are now available in `man` format as `fish-doc`, `fish-tutorial` and `fish-faq` respectively (#5521).\r\n- Like other shells, `cd` now always looks for its argument in the current directory as a last resort, even if the `CDPATH` variable does not include it or \".\" (#4484).\r\n- fish now correctly handles `CDPATH` entries that start with `..` (#6220) or contain `./` (#5887).\r\n- The `fish_trace` variable may be set to trace execution (#3427). This performs a similar role as `set -x` in other shells.\r\n- fish uses the temporary directory determined by the system, rather than relying on `/tmp` (#3845).\r\n- The fish Web configuration tool (`fish_config`) prints a list of commands it is executing, to help understanding and debugging (#5584).\r\n- Major performance improvements when pasting (#5866), executing lots of commands (#5905), importing history from bash (#6295), and when completing variables that might match `$history` (#6288).\r\n\r\n### Syntax changes and new commands\r\n- A new builtin command, `time`, which allows timing of fish functions and builtins as well as external commands (#117).\r\n- Brace expansion now only takes place if the braces include a \",\" or a variable expansion, meaning common commands such as `git reset HEAD@{0}` do not require escaping (#5869).\r\n- New redirections `&>` and `&|` may be used to redirect or pipe stdout, and also redirect stderr to stdout (#6192).\r\n- `switch` now allows arguments that expand to nothing, like empty variables (#5677).\r\n- The `VAR=val cmd` syntax can now be used to run a command in a modified environment (#6287).\r\n- `and` is no longer recognised as a command, so that nonsensical constructs like `and and and` produce a syntax error (#6089).\r\n- `math`'s exponent operator, '`^`', was previously left-associative, but now uses the more commonly-used right-associative behaviour (#6280). This means that `math '3^0.5^2'` was previously calculated as '(3^0.5)^2', but is now calculated as '3^(0.5^2)'.\r\n- In fish 3.0, the variable used with `for` loops inside command substitutions could leak into enclosing scopes; this was an inadvertent behaviour change and has been reverted (#6480).\r\n\r\n### Scripting improvements\r\n- `string split0` now returns 0 if it split something (#5701).\r\n- In the interest of consistency, `builtin -q` and `command -q` can now be used to query if a builtin or command exists (#5631).\r\n- `math` now accepts `--scale=max` for the maximum scale (#5579).\r\n- `builtin $var` now works correctly, allowing a variable as the builtin name (#5639).\r\n- `cd` understands the `--` argument to make it possible to change to directories starting with a hyphen (#6071).\r\n- `complete --do-complete` now also does fuzzy matches (#5467).\r\n- `complete --do-complete` can be used inside completions, allowing limited recursion (#3474).\r\n- `count` now also counts lines fed on standard input (#5744).\r\n- `eval` produces an exit status of 0 when given no arguments, like other shells (#5692).\r\n- `printf` prints what it can when input hasn't been fully converted to a number, but still prints an error (#5532).\r\n- `complete -C foo` now works as expected, rather than requiring `complete -Cfoo`.\r\n- `complete` has a new `--force-files` option, to re-enable file completions. This allows `sudo -E` and `pacman -Qo` to complete correctly (#5646).\r\n- `argparse` now defaults to showing the current function name (instead of `argparse`) in its errors, making `--name` often superfluous (#5835).\r\n- `argparse` has a new `--ignore-unknown` option to keep unrecognized options, allowing multiple argparse passes to parse options (#5367).\r\n- `argparse` correctly handles flag value validation of options that only have short names (#5864).\r\n- `read -S` (short option of `--shell`) is recognised correctly (#5660).\r\n- `read` understands `--list`, which acts like `--array` in reading all arguments into a list inside a single variable, but is better named (#5846).\r\n- `read` has a new option, `--tokenize`, which splits a string into variables according to the shell's tokenization rules, considering quoting, escaping, and so on (#3823).\r\n- `read` interacts more correctly with the deprecated `$IFS` variable, in particular removing multiple separators when splitting a variable into a list (#6406), matching other shells.\r\n- `fish_indent` now handles semicolons better, including leaving them in place for `; and` and `; or` instead of breaking the line (#5859).\r\n- `fish_indent --write` now supports multiple file arguments, indenting them in turn.\r\n- The default read limit has been increased to 100MiB (#5267).\r\n- `math` now also understands `x` for multiplication, provided it is followed by whitespace (#5906).\r\n- `math` reports the right error when incorrect syntax is used inside parentheses (#6063), and warns when unsupported logical operations are used (#6096).\r\n- `functions --erase` now also prevents fish from autoloading a function for the first time (#5951).\r\n- `jobs --last` returns 0 to indicate success when a job is found (#6104).\r\n- `commandline -p` and `commandline -j` now split on `&&` and `||` in addition to `;` and `&` (#6214).\r\n- A bug where `string split` would drop empty strings if the output was only empty strings has been fixed (#5987).\r\n- `eval` no long creates a new local variable scope, but affects variables in the scope it is called from (#4443). `source` still creates a new local scope.\r\n- `abbr` has a new `--query` option to check for the existence of an abbreviation.\r\n- Local values for `fish_complete_path` and `fish_function_path` are now ignored; only their global values are respected.\r\n- Syntax error reports now display a marker in the correct position (#5812).\r\n- Empty universal variables may now be exported (#5992).\r\n- Exported universal variables are no longer imported into the global scope, preventing shadowing. This makes it easier to change such variables for all fish sessions and avoids breakage when the value is a list of multiple elements (#5258).\r\n- A bug where `for` could use invalid variable names has been fixed (#5800).\r\n- A bug where local variables would not be exported to functions has been fixed (#6153).\r\n- The null command (`:`) now always exits successfully, rather than passing through the previous exit status (#6022).\r\n- The output of `functions FUNCTION` matches the declaration of the function, correctly including comments or blank lines (#5285), and correctly includes any `--wraps` flags (#1625).\r\n- `type` supports a new option, `--short`, which suppress function expansion (#6403).\r\n- `type --path` with a function argument will now output the path to the file containing the definition of that function, if it exists.\r\n- `type --force-path` with an argument that cannot be found now correctly outputs nothing, as documented (#6411).\r\n- The `$hostname` variable is no longer truncated to 32 characters (#5758).\r\n- Line numbers in function backtraces are calculated correctly (#6350).\r\n- A new `fish_cancel` event is emitted when the command line is cancelled, which is useful for terminal integration (#5973).\r\n\r\n### Interactive improvements\r\n- New Base16 color options are available through the Web-based configuration (#6504).\r\n- fish only parses `/etc/paths` on macOS in login shells, matching the bash implementation (#5637) and avoiding changes to path ordering in child shells (#5456). It now ignores blank lines like the bash implementation (#5809).\r\n- The locale is now reloaded when the `LOCPATH` variable is changed (#5815).\r\n- `read` no longer keeps a history, making it suitable for operations that shouldn't end up there, like password entry (#5904).\r\n- `dirh` outputs its stack in the correct order (#5477), and behaves as documented when universal variables are used for its stack (#5797).\r\n- `funced` and the edit-commandline-in-buffer bindings did not work in fish 3.0 when the `$EDITOR` variable contained spaces; this has been corrected (#5625).\r\n- Builtins now pipe their help output to a pager automatically (#6227).\r\n- `set_color` now colors the `--print-colors` output in the matching colors if it is going to a terminal.\r\n- fish now underlines every valid entered path instead of just the last one (#5872).\r\n- When syntax highlighting a string with an unclosed quote, only the quote itself will be shown as an error, instead of the whole argument.\r\n- Syntax highlighting works correctly with variables as commands (#5658) and redirections to close file descriptors (#6092).\r\n- `help` works properly on Windows Subsytem for Linux (#5759, #6338).\r\n- A bug where `disown` could crash the shell has been fixed (#5720).\r\n- fish will not autosuggest files ending with `~` unless there are no other candidates, as these are generally backup files (#985).\r\n- Escape in the pager works correctly (#5818).\r\n- Key bindings that call `fg` no longer leave the terminal in a broken state (#2114).\r\n- Brackets (#5831) and filenames containing `$` (#6060) are completed with appropriate escaping.\r\n- The output of `complete` and `functions` is now colorized in interactive terminals.\r\n- The Web-based configuration handles aliases that include single quotes correctly (#6120), and launches correctly under Termux (#6248) and OpenBSD (#6522).\r\n- `function` now correctly validates parameters for `--argument-names` as valid variable names (#6147) and correctly parses options following `--argument-names`, as in \"`--argument-names foo --description bar`\" (#6186).\r\n- History newly imported from bash includes command lines using `&&` or `||`.\r\n- The automatic generation of completions from manual pages is better described in job and process listings, and no longer produces a warning when exiting fish (#6269).\r\n- In private mode, setting `$fish_greeting` to an empty string before starting the private session will prevent the warning about history not being saved from being printed (#6299).\r\n- In the interactive editor, a line break (Enter) inside unclosed brackets will insert a new line, rather than executing the command and producing an error (#6316).\r\n- Ctrl-C always repaints the prompt (#6394).\r\n- When run interactively from another program (such as Python), fish will correctly start a new process group, like other shells (#5909).\r\n- Job identifiers (for example, for background jobs) are assigned more logically (#6053).\r\n- A bug where history would appear truncated if an empty command was executed was fixed (#6032).\r\n\r\n#### New or improved bindings\r\n- Pasting strips leading spaces to avoid pasted commands being omitted from the history (#4327).\r\n- Shift-Left and Shift-Right now default to moving backwards and forwards by one bigword (words separated by whitespace) (#1505).\r\n- The default escape delay (to differentiate between the escape key and an alt-combination) has been reduced to 30ms, down from 300ms for the default mode and 100ms for Vi mode (#3904).\r\n- The `forward-bigword` binding now interacts correctly with autosuggestions (#5336).\r\n- The `fish_clipboard_*` functions support Wayland by using [`wl-clipboard`](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard) (#5450).\r\n- The `nextd` and `prevd` functions no longer print \"Hit end of history\", instead using a bell. They correctly store working directories containing symbolic links (#6395).\r\n- If a `fish_mode_prompt` function exists, Vi mode will only execute it on mode-switch instead of the entire prompt. This should make it much more responsive with slow prompts (#5783).\r\n- The path-component bindings (like Ctrl-w) now also stop at \":\" and \"@\", because those are used to denote user and host in commands such as `ssh` (#5841).\r\n- The NULL character can now be bound via `bind -k nul`. Terminals often generate this character via control-space. (#3189).\r\n- A new readline command `expand-abbr` can be used to trigger abbreviation expansion (#5762).\r\n- A new readline command, `delete-or-exit`, removes a character to the right of the cursor or exits the shell if the command line is empty (moving this functionality out of the `delete-or-exit` function).\r\n- The `self-insert` readline command will now insert the binding sequence, if not empty.\r\n- A new binding to prepend `sudo`, bound to Alt-S by default (#6140).\r\n- The Alt-W binding to describe a command should now work better with multiline prompts (#6110)\r\n- The Alt-H binding to open a command's man page now tries to ignore `sudo` (#6122).\r\n- A new pair of bind functions, `history-prefix-search-backward` (and `forward`), was introduced (#6143).\r\n- Vi mode now supports R to enter replace mode (#6342), and `d0` to delete the current line (#6292).\r\n- In Vi mode, hitting Enter in replace-one mode no longer erases the prompt (#6298).\r\n- Selections in Vi mode are inclusive, matching the actual behaviour of Vi (#5770).\r\n\r\n#### Improved prompts\r\n- The Git prompt in informative mode now shows the number of stashes if enabled.\r\n- The Git prompt now has an option (`$__fish_git_prompt_use_informative_chars`) to use the (more modern) informative characters without enabling informative mode.\r\n- The default prompt now also features VCS integration and will color the host if running via SSH (#6375).\r\n- The default and example prompts print the pipe status if an earlier command in the pipe fails.\r\n- The default and example prompts try to resolve exit statuses to signal names when appropriate.\r\n\r\n#### Improved terminal output\r\n- New `fish_pager_color_` options have been added to control more elements of the pager's colors (#5524).\r\n- Better detection and support for using fish from various system consoles, where limited colors and special characters are supported (#5552).\r\n- fish now tries to guess if the system supports Unicode 9 (and displays emoji as wide), eliminating the need to set `$fish_emoji_width` in most cases (#5722).\r\n- Improvements to the display of wide characters, particularly Korean characters and emoji (#5583, #5729).\r\n- The Vi mode cursor is correctly redrawn when regaining focus under terminals that report focus (eg tmux) (#4788).\r\n- Variables that control background colors (such as `fish_pager_color_search_match`) can now use `--reverse`.\r\n\r\n#### Completions\r\n- Added completions for\r\n  - `aws`\r\n  - `bat` (#6052)\r\n  - `bosh` (#5700)\r\n  - `btrfs`\r\n  - `camcontrol`\r\n  - `cf` (#5700)\r\n  - `chronyc` (#6496)\r\n  - `code` (#6205)\r\n  - `cryptsetup` (#6488)\r\n  - `csc` and `csi` (#6016)\r\n  - `cwebp` (#6034)\r\n  - `cygpath` and `cygstart` (#6239)\r\n  - `epkginfo` (#5829)\r\n  - `ffmpeg`, `ffplay`, and `ffprobe` (#5922)\r\n  - `fsharpc` and `fsharpi` (#6016)\r\n  - `fzf` (#6178)\r\n  - `g++` (#6217)\r\n  - `gpg1` (#6139)\r\n  - `gpg2` (#6062)\r\n  - `grub-mkrescue` (#6182)\r\n  - `hledger` (#6043)\r\n  - `hwinfo` (#6496)\r\n  - `irb` (#6260)\r\n  - `iw` (#6232)\r\n  - `kak`\r\n  - `keepassxc-cli` (#6505)\r\n  - `keybase` (#6410)\r\n  - `loginctl` (#6501)\r\n  - `lz4`, `lz4c` and `lz4cat` (#6364)\r\n  - `mariner` (#5718)\r\n  - `nethack` (#6240)\r\n  - `patool` (#6083)\r\n  - `phpunit` (#6197)\r\n  - `plutil` (#6301)\r\n  - `pzstd` (#6364)\r\n  - `qubes-gpg-client` (#6067)\r\n  - `resolvectl` (#6501)\r\n  - `rg`\r\n  - `rustup`\r\n  - `sfdx` (#6149)\r\n  - `speedtest` and `speedtest-cli` (#5840)\r\n  - `src` (#6026)\r\n  - `tokei` (#6085)\r\n  - `tsc` (#6016)\r\n  - `unlz4` (#6364)\r\n  - `unzstd` (#6364)\r\n  - `vbc` (#6016)\r\n  - `zpaq` (#6245)\r\n  - `zstd`, `zstdcat`, `zstdgrep`, `zstdless` and `zstdmt` (#6364)\r\n- Lots of improvements to completions.\r\n- Selecting short options which also have a long name from the completion pager is possible (#5634).\r\n- Tab completion will no longer add trailing spaces if they already exist (#6107).\r\n- Completion of subcommands to builtins like `and` or `not` now works correctly (#6249).\r\n- Completion of arguments to short options works correctly when multiple short options are used together (#332).\r\n- Activating completion in the middle of an invalid completion does not move the cursor any more, making it easier to fix a mistake (#4124).\r\n- Completion in empty commandlines now lists all available commands.\r\n- Functions listed as completions could previously leak parts of the function as other completions; this has been fixed.\r\n\r\n### Deprecations and removed features\r\n- The vcs-prompt functions have been promoted to names without double-underscore, so __fish_git_prompt is now fish_git_prompt, __fish_vcs_prompt is now fish_vcs_prompt, __fish_hg_prompt is now fish_hg_prompt and __fish_svn_prompt is now fish_svn_prompt. Shims at the old names have been added, and the variables have kept their old names (#5586).\r\n- `string replace` has an additional round of escaping in the replacement expression, so escaping backslashes requires many escapes (eg `string replace -ra '([ab])' '\\\\\\\\\\\\\\$1' a`). The new feature flag `regex-easyesc` can be used to disable this, so that the same effect can be achieved with `string replace -ra '([ab])' '\\\\\\\\$1' a` (#5556). As a reminder, the intention behind feature flags is that this will eventually become the default and then only option, so scripts should be updated.\r\n- The `fish_vi_mode` function, deprecated in fish 2.3, has been removed. Use `fish_vi_key_bindings` instead (#6372).\r\n\r\n### For distributors and developers\r\n- fish 3.0 introduced a CMake-based build system. In fish 3.1, both the Autotools-based build and legacy Xcode build system have been removed, leaving only the CMake build system. All distributors and developers must install CMake.\r\n- fish now depends on the common `tee` external command, for the `psub` process substitution function.\r\n- The documentation is now built with Sphinx. The old Doxygen-based documentation system has been removed. Developers, and distributors who wish to rebuild the documentation, must install Sphinx.\r\n- The `INTERNAL_WCWIDTH` build option has been removed, as fish now always uses an internal `wcwidth` function. It has a number of configuration options that make it more suitable for general use (#5777).\r\n- mandoc can now be used to format the output from `--help` if `nroff` is not installed, reducing the number of external dependencies on systems with `mandoc` installed (#5489).\r\n- Some bugs preventing building on Solaris-derived systems such as Illumos were fixed (#5458, #5461, #5611).\r\n- Completions for `npm`, `bower` and `yarn` no longer require the `jq` utility for full functionality, but will use Python instead if it is available.\r\n- The paths for completions, functions and configuration snippets have been extended. On systems that define `XDG_DATA_DIRS`, each of the directories in this variable are searched in the subdirectories `fish/vendor_completions.d`, `fish/vendor_functions.d`, and `fish/vendor_conf.d` respectively. On systems that do not define this variable in the environment, the vendor directories are searched for in both the installation prefix and the default \"extra\" directory, which now defaults to `/usr/local` (#5029).",

The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" will not build correctly. The SHA-256 sum of this file is 21677a5755ee1738bad2cf8179c104068f8bb81b969660d5a2af4ba6eceba5e4. A GPG signature from David Adam (0x7A67D962D88A709A) is available as \"fish-3.0.1.tar.gz.asc\".*\r\n\r\n### Fixes and improvements\r\n\r\n- `exec` does not complain about running foreground jobs when called (#5449).\r\n- while loops now evaluate to the last executed command in the loop body (or zero if the body was empty), matching POSIX semantics (#4982).\r\n- `read --silent` no longer echoes to the tty when run from a non-interactive script (#5519).\r\n- On macOS, path entries with spaces in `/etc/paths` and `/etc/paths.d` now correctly set path entries with spaces. Likewise, `MANPATH` is correctly set from `/etc/manpaths` and `/etc/manpaths.d` (#5481).\r\n- fish starts correctly under Cygwin/MSYS2 (#5426).\r\n- The `pager-toggle-search` binding (Ctrl-S by default) will now activate the search field, even when the pager is not focused.\r\n- The error when a command is not found is now printed a single time, instead of once per argument (#5588).\r\n- Fixes and improvements to the git completions, including printing correct paths with older git versions, fuzzy matching again, reducing unnecessary offers of root paths (starting with `:/`) (#5578, #5574, #5476), and ignoring shell aliases, so enterprising users can set up the wrapping command (via `set -g __fish_git_alias_$command $whatitwraps`) (#5412).\r\n- Significant performance improvements to core shell functions (#5447) and to the `kill` completions (#5541). \r\n- Starting in symbolically-linked working directories works correctly (#5525).\r\n- The default `fish_title` function no longer contains extra spaces (#5517).\r\n- The `nim` prompt now works correctly when chosen in the Web-based configuration (#5490).\r\n- `string` now prints help to stdout, like other builtins (#5495).\r\n- Killing the terminal while fish is in vi normal mode will no longer send it spinning and eating CPU. (#5528)\r\n- A number of crashes have been fixed (#5550, #5548, #5479, #5453).\r\n- Improvements to the documentation and certain completions.\r\n\r\n### Known issues\r\n\r\nThere is one significant known issue that was not corrected before the release:\r\n\r\n- fish does not run correctly under Windows Services for Linux before Windows 10 version 1809/17763, and the message warning of this may not be displayed (#5619).\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading from version 2.7.1 or before, please also review the release notes for 3.0.0 and 3.0b1.",

Although most existing scripts will continue to work, they should be reviewed against the list contained below.\r\n\r\n_Download links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-3.0.0.tar.gz\". The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" may not build correctly. The SHA-256 sum of this file is ea9dd3614bb0346829ce7319437c6a93e3e1dfde3b7f6a469b543b0d2c68f2cf. A GPG signature from David Adam (0x7A67D962D88A709A) is available as \"fish-3.0.0.tar.gz.asc\"._\r\n\r\nCompared to the beta release of fish 3.0b1, fish version 3.0.0:\r\n\r\n- builds correctly against musl libc (#5407)\r\n- handles huge numeric arguments to `test` correctly (#5414)\r\n- removes the history colouring introduced in 3.0b1, which did not always work correctly\r\n\r\nThere is one significant known issue which was not able to be corrected before the release:\r\n\r\n- fish 3.0.0 builds on Cygwin (#5423), but does not run correctly (#5426) and will result in a hanging terminal when started. Cygwin users are encouraged to continue using 2.7.1 until a release which corrects this is available.\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading from version 2.7.1 or before, please also review the release notes for 3.0b1, which follow.\r\n\r\n## Notable non-backward compatible changes\r\n-  Process and job expansion has largely been removed. `%` will no longer perform these expansions, except for `%self` for the PID of the current shell. Additionally, job management commands (`disown`, `wait`, `bg`, `fg` and `kill`) will expand job specifiers starting with `%` (#4230, #1202).\r\n- `set x[1] x[2] a b`, to set multiple elements of an array at once, is no longer valid syntax (#4236).\r\n- A literal `{}` now expands to itself, rather than nothing. This makes working with `find -exec` easier (#1109, #4632).\r\n- Literally accessing a zero-index is now illegal syntax and is caught by the parser (#4862). (fish indices start at 1)\r\n- Successive commas in brace expansions are handled in less surprising manner. For example, `{,,,}` expands to four empty strings rather than an empty string, a comma and an empty string again (#3002, #4632).\r\n- `for` loop control variables are no longer local to the `for` block (#1935).\r\n- Variables set in `if` and `while` conditions are available outside the block (#4820).\r\n- Local exported (`set -lx`) vars are now visible to functions (#1091).\r\n- The new `math` builtin (see below) does not support logical expressions; `test` should be used instead (#4777).\r\n- Range expansion will now behave sensibly when given a single positive and negative index (`$foo[5..-1]` or `$foo[-1..5]`), clamping to the last valid index without changing direction if the list has fewer elements than expected.\r\n- `read` now uses `-s` as short for `--silent` (\u00e0 la `bash`); `--shell`'s abbreviation (formerly `-s`) is now `-S` instead (#4490).\r\n- `cd` no longer resolves symlinks. fish now maintains a virtual path, matching other shells (#3350).\r\n- `source` now requires an explicit `-` as the filename to read from the terminal (#2633).\r\n- Arguments to `end` are now errors, instead of being silently ignored.\r\n- The names `argparse`, `read`, `set`, `status`, `test` and `[` are now reserved and not allowed as function names. This prevents users unintentionally breaking stuff (#3000).\r\n- The `fish_user_abbreviations` variable is no longer used; abbreviations will be migrated to the new storage format automatically.\r\n- The `FISH_READ_BYTE_LIMIT` variable is now called `fish_byte_limit` (#4414).\r\n- Environment variables are no longer split into arrays based on the record separator character on startup. Instead, variables are not split, unless their name ends in PATH, in which case they are split on colons (#436).\r\n- The `history` builtin's `--with-time` option has been removed; this has been deprecated in favor of `--show-time` since 2.7.0 (#4403).\r\n- The internal variables `__fish_datadir` and `__fish_sysconfdir` are now known as `__fish_data_dir` and `__fish_sysconf_dir` respectively.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\nWith the release of fish 3, a number of features have been marked for removal in the future. All users are encouraged to explore alternatives. A small number of these features are currently behind feature flags, which are turned on at present but may be turned off by default in the future.\r\n\r\nA new feature flags mechanism is added for staging deprecations and breaking changes. Feature flags may be specified at launch with `fish --features ...` or by setting the universal `fish_features` variable. (#4940)\r\n\r\n- The use of the `IFS` variable for `read` is deprecated; `IFS` will be ignored in the future (#4156). Use the `read --delimiter` option instead.\r\n- The `function --on-process-exit` switch will be removed in future (#4700). Use the `fish_exit` event instead: `function --on-event fish_exit`.\r\n- `$_` is deprecated and will removed in the future (#813). Use `status current-command` in a command substitution instead.\r\n- `^` as a redirection deprecated and will be removed in the future. (#4394). Use `2>` to redirect stderr. This is controlled by the `stderr-nocaret` feature flag.\r\n- `?` as a glob (wildcard) is deprecated and will be removed in the future (#4520). This is controlled by the `qmark-noglob` feature flag.\r\n\r\n## Notable fixes and improvements\r\n### Syntax changes and new commands\r\n- fish now supports `&&` (like `and`), `||` (like `or`), and `!` (like `not`), for better migration from POSIX-compliant shells (#4620).\r\n- Variables may be used as commands (#154).\r\n- fish may be started in private mode via `fish --private`. Private mode fish sessions do not have access to the history file and any commands evaluated in private mode are not persisted for future sessions. A session variable `$fish_private_mode` can be queried to detect private mode and adjust the behavior of scripts accordingly to respect the user's wish for privacy.\r\n- A new `wait` command for waiting on backgrounded processes (#4498).\r\n- `math` is now a builtin rather than a wrapper around `bc` (#3157). Floating point computations is now used by default, and can be controlled with the new `--scale` option (#4478).\r\n- Setting `$PATH` no longer warns on non-existent directories, allowing for a single $PATH to be shared across machines (eg via dotfiles) (#2969).\r\n- `while` sets `$status` to a non-zero value if the loop is not executed (#4982).\r\n- Command substitution output is now limited to 10 MB by default, controlled by the `fish_read_limit` variable (#3822). Notably, this is larger than most operating systems' argument size limit, so trying to pass argument lists this size to external commands has never worked.\r\n- The machine hostname, where available, is now exposed as the `$hostname` reserved variable. This removes the dependency on the `hostname` executable (#4422).\r\n- Bare `bind` invocations in config.fish now work. The `fish_user_key_bindings` function is no longer necessary, but will still be executed if it exists (#5191).\r\n- `$fish_pid` and `$last_pid` are available as replacements for `%self` and `%last`.\r\n\r\n### New features in commands\r\n- `alias` has a new `--save` option to save the generated function immediately (#4878).\r\n- `bind` has a new `--silent` option to ignore bind requests for named keys not available under the current terminal (#4188, #4431).\r\n- `complete` has a new `--keep-order` option to show the provided or dynamically-generated argument list in the same order as specified, rather than alphabetically (#361).\r\n- `exec` prompts for confirmation if background jobs are running.\r\n- `funced` has a new `--save` option to automatically save the edited function after successfully editing (#4668).\r\n- `functions` has a new ` --handlers` option to show functions registered as event handlers (#4694).\r\n- `history search` supports globs for wildcard searching (#3136) and has a new `--reverse` option to show entries from oldest to newest (#4375).\r\n- `jobs` has a new `--quiet` option to silence the output.\r\n- `read` has a new `--delimiter` option for splitting input into arrays (#4256).\r\n- `read` writes directly to stdout if called without arguments (#4407).\r\n- `read` can now read individual lines into separate variables without consuming the input in its entirety via the new `/--line` option.\r\n- `set` has new `--append` and `--prepend` options (#1326).\r\n- `set` has a new `--show` option to show lots of information about variables (#4265).\r\n- `string match` with an empty pattern and `--entire` in glob mode now matches everything instead of nothing (#4971).\r\n- `string split` supports a new `--no-empty` option to exclude empty strings from the result (#4779).\r\n- `string` has new subcommands `split0` and `join0` for working with NUL-delimited output.\r\n- `string` no longer stops processing text after NUL characters (#4605)\r\n- `string escape` has a new `--style regex` option for escaping strings to be matched literally in `string` regex operations.\r\n- `test` now supports floating point values in numeric comparisons.\r\n\r\n### Interactive improvements\r\n- A pipe at the end of a line now allows the job to continue on the next line (#1285).\r\n- Italics and dim support out of the box on macOS for Terminal.app and iTerm (#4436).\r\n- `cd` tab completions no longer descend into the deepest unambiguous path (#4649).\r\n- Pager navigation has been improved. Most notably, moving down now wraps around, moving up from the commandline now jumps to the last element and moving right and left now reverse each other even when wrapping around (#4680).\r\n- Typing normal characters while the completion pager is active no longer shows the search field. Instead it enters them into the command line, and ends paging (#2249).\r\n- A new input binding `pager-toggle-search` toggles the search field in the completions pager on and off. By default, this is bound to Ctrl-S.\r\n- Searching in the pager now does a full fuzzy search (#5213).\r\n- The pager will now show the full command instead of just its last line if the number of completions is large (#4702).\r\n- Abbreviations can be tab-completed (#3233).\r\n- Tildes in file names are now properly escaped in completions (#2274).\r\n- Wrapping completions (from `complete --wraps` or `function --wraps`) can now inject arguments. For example, `complete gco --wraps 'git checkout'` now works properly (#1976). The `alias` function has been updated to respect this behavior.\r\n- Path completions now support expansions, meaning expressions like `python ~/<TAB>` now provides file suggestions just like any other relative or absolute path. (This includes support for other expansions, too.)\r\n- Autosuggestions try to avoid arguments that are already present in the command line.\r\n- Notifications about crashed processes are now always shown, even in command substitutions (#4962).\r\n- The screen is no longer reset after a BEL, fixing graphical glitches (#3693).\r\n- vi-mode now supports ';' and ',' motions. This introduces new {forward,backward}-jump-till and repeat-jump{,-reverse} bind functions (#5140).\r\n- The `*y` vi-mode binding now works (#5100).\r\n- True color is now enabled in neovim by default (#2792).\r\n- Terminal size variables (`$COLUMNS`/`$LINES`) are now updated before `fish_prompt` is called, allowing the prompt to react (#904).\r\n- Multi-line prompts no longer repeat when the terminal is resized (#2320).\r\n- `xclip` support has been added to the clipboard integration (#5020).\r\n- The Alt-P keybinding paginates the last command if the command line is empty.\r\n- `$cmd_duration` is no longer reset when no command is executed (#5011).\r\n- Deleting a one-character word no longer erases the next word as well (#4747).\r\n- Token history search (Alt-Up) omits duplicate entries (#4795).\r\n- The `fish_escape_delay_ms` timeout, allowing the use of the escape key both on its own and as part of a control sequence, was applied to all control characters; this has been reduced to just the escape key.\r\n- Completing a function shows the description properly (#5206).\r\n- Added completions for\r\n  - `ansible`, including `ansible-galaxy`, `ansible-playbook` and `ansible-vault` (#4697)\r\n  - `bb-power` (#4800)\r\n  - `bd` (#4472)\r\n  - `bower`\r\n  - `clang` and `clang++` (#4174)\r\n  - `conda` (#4837)\r\n  - `configure` (for autoconf-generated files only)\r\n  - `curl`\r\n  - `doas` (#5196)\r\n  - `ebuild` (#4911)\r\n  - `emaint` (#4758)\r\n  - `eopkg` (#4600)\r\n  - `exercism` (#4495)\r\n  - `hjson`\r\n  - `hugo` (#4529)\r\n  - `j` (from autojump #4344)\r\n  - `jbake` (#4814)\r\n  - `jhipster` (#4472)\r\n  - `kitty`\r\n  - `kldload`\r\n  - `kldunload`\r\n  - `makensis` (#5242)\r\n  - `meson`\r\n  - `mkdocs` (#4906)\r\n  - `ngrok` (#4642)\r\n  - OpenBSD's `pkg_add`, `pkg_delete`, `pkg_info`, `pfctl`, `rcctl`, `signify`, and `vmctl` (#4584)\r\n  - `openocd`\r\n  - `optipng`\r\n  - `opkg` (#5168)\r\n  - `pandoc` (#2937)\r\n  - `port` (#4737)\r\n  - `powerpill` (#4800)\r\n  - `pstack` (#5135)\r\n  - `serve` (#5026)\r\n  - `ttx`\r\n  - `unzip`\r\n  - `virsh` (#5113)\r\n  - `xclip` (#5126)\r\n  - `xsv`\r\n  - `zfs` and `zpool` (#4608)\r\n- Lots of improvements to completions (especially `darcs` (#5112), `git`, `hg` and `sudo`).\r\n- Completions for `yarn` and `npm` now require the `all-the-package-names` NPM package for full functionality.\r\n- Completions for `bower` and `yarn` now require the `jq` utility for full functionality.\r\n- Improved French translations.\r\n\r\n### Other fixes and improvements\r\n- Significant performance improvements to `abbr` (#4048), setting variables (#4200, #4341), executing functions, globs (#4579), `string` reading from standard input (#4610), and slicing history (in particular, `$history[1]` for the last executed command).\r\n- Fish's internal wcwidth function has been updated to deal with newer Unicode, and the width of some characters can be configured via the `fish_ambiguous_width` (#5149) and `fish_emoji_width` (#2652) variables. Alternatively, a new build-time option INTERNAL_WCWIDTH can be used to use the system's wcwidth instead (#4816).\r\n- `functions` correctly supports `-d` as the short form of `--description`. (#5105)\r\n- `/etc/paths` is now parsed like macOS' bash `path_helper`, fixing $PATH order (#4336, #4852) on macOS.\r\n- Using a read-only variable in a `for` loop produces an error, rather than silently producing incorrect results (#4342).\r\n- The universal variables filename no longer contains the hostname or MAC address. It is now at the fixed location `.config/fish/fish_variables` (#1912).\r\n- Exported variables in the global or universal scope no longer have their exported status affected by local variables (#2611).\r\n- Major rework of terminal and job handling to eliminate bugs (#3805, #3952, #4178, #4235, #4238, #4540, #4929, #5210).\r\n- Improvements to the manual page completion generator (#2937, #4313).\r\n- `suspend --force` now works correctly (#4672).\r\n- Pressing Ctrl-C while running a script now reliably terminates fish (#5253).\r\n\r\n### For distributors and developers\r\n- fish ships with a new build system based on CMake. CMake 3.2 is the minimum required version. Although the autotools-based Makefile and the Xcode project are still shipped with this release, they will be removed in the near future. All distributors and developers are encouraged to migrate to the CMake build.\r\n- Build scripts for most platforms no longer require bash, using the standard sh instead.\r\n- The `hostname` command is no longer required for fish to operate.\r\n",

        "body": "fish 3 is a major release, which introduces some breaking changes alongside improved functionality. Although most existing scripts will continue to work, they should be reviewed against the list below.\r\n\r\n_To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-3.0b1.tar.gz\". The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" will not build correctly. The SHA-256 sum of this file is 11c464ac9f2b838b0a9e3fb8e91f7727649d0d13122b5bcb7bc4e5199bc5e8a6. A GPG signature from David Adam (0x7A67D962D88A709A) is available as \"fish-3.0b1.tar.gz.asc\"._\r\n\r\n## Notable non-backward compatible changes\r\n-  Process and job expansion has largely been removed. `%` will no longer perform these expansions, except for `%self` for the PID of the current shell. Additionally, job management commands (`disown`, `wait`, `bg`, `fg` and `kill`) will expand job specifiers starting with `%` (#4230, #1202).\r\n- `set x[1] x[2] a b`, to set multiple elements of an array at once, is no longer valid syntax (#4236).\r\n- A literal `{}` now expands to itself, rather than nothing. This makes working with `find -exec` easier (#1109, #4632).\r\n- Literally accessing a zero-index is now illegal syntax and is caught by the parser (#4862). (fish indices start at 1)\r\n- Successive commas in brace expansions are handled in less surprising manner. For example, `{,,,}` expands to four empty strings rather than an empty string, a comma and an empty string again (#3002, #4632).\r\n- `for` loop control variables are no longer local to the `for` block (#1935).\r\n- Variables set in `if` and `while` conditions are available outside the block (#4820).\r\n- Local exported (`set -lx`) vars are now visible to functions (#1091).\r\n- The new `math` builtin (see below) does not support logical expressions; `test` should be used instead (#4777).\r\n- Range expansion will now behave sensibly when given a single positive and negative index (`$foo[5..-1]` or `$foo[-1..5]`), clamping to the last valid index without changing direction if the list has fewer elements than expected.\r\n- `read` now uses `-s` as short for `--silent` (\u00e0 la `bash`); `--shell`'s abbreviation (formerly `-s`) is now `-S` instead (#4490).\r\n- `cd` no longer resolves symlinks. fish now maintains a virtual path, matching other shells (#3350).\r\n- `source` now requires an explicit `-` as the filename to read from the terminal (#2633).\r\n- Arguments to `end` are now errors, instead of being silently ignored.\r\n- The names `argparse`, `read`, `set`, `status`, `test` and `[` are now reserved and not allowed as function names. This prevents users unintentionally breaking stuff (#3000).\r\n- The `fish_user_abbreviations` variable is no longer used; abbreviations will be migrated to the new storage format automatically.\r\n- The `FISH_READ_BYTE_LIMIT` variable is now called `fish_byte_limit` (#4414).\r\n- Environment variables are no longer split into arrays based on the record separator character on startup. Instead, variables are not split, unless their name ends in PATH, in which case they are split on colons (#436).\r\n- The `history` builtin's `--with-time` option has been removed; this has been deprecated in favor of `--show-time` since 2.7.0 (#4403).\r\n- The internal variables `__fish_datadir` and `__fish_sysconfdir` are now known as `__fish_data_dir` and `__fish_sysconf_dir` respectively.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\nWith the release of fish 3, a number of features have been marked for removal in the future. All users are encouraged to explore alternatives. A small number of these features are currently behind feature flags, which are turned on at present but may be turned off by default in the future.\r\n\r\nA new feature flags mechanism is added for staging deprecations and breaking changes. Feature flags may be specified at launch with `fish --features ...` or by setting the universal `fish_features` variable. (#4940)\r\n\r\n- The use of the `IFS` variable for `read` is deprecated; `IFS` will be ignored in the future (#4156). Use the `read --delimiter` option instead.\r\n- The `function --on-process-exit` switch will be removed in future (#4700). Use the `fish_exit` event instead: `function --on-event fish_exit`.\r\n- `$_` is deprecated and will removed in the future (#813). Use `status current-command` in a command substitution instead.\r\n- `^` as a redirection deprecated and will be removed in the future. (#4394). Use `2>` to redirect stderr. This is controlled by the `stderr-nocaret` feature flag.\r\n- `?` as a glob (wildcard) is deprecated and will be removed in the future (#4520). This is controlled by the `qmark-noglob` feature flag.\r\n\r\n## Notable fixes and improvements\r\n### Syntax changes and new commands\r\n- fish now supports `&&` (like `and`), `||` (like `or`), and `!` (like `not`), for better migration from POSIX-compliant shells (#4620).\r\n- Variables may be used as commands (#154).\r\n- fish may be started in private mode via `fish --private`. Private mode fish sessions do not have access to the history file and any commands evaluated in private mode are not persisted for future sessions. A session variable `$fish_private_mode` can be queried to detect private mode and adjust the behavior of scripts accordingly to respect the user's wish for privacy.\r\n- A new `wait` command for waiting on backgrounded processes (#4498).\r\n- `math` is now a builtin rather than a wrapper around `bc` (#3157). Floating point computations is now used by default, and can be controlled with the new `--scale` option (#4478).\r\n- Setting `$PATH` no longer warns on non-existent directories, allowing for a single $PATH to be shared across machines (eg via dotfiles) (#2969).\r\n- `while` sets `$status` to a non-zero value if the loop is not executed (#4982).\r\n- Command substitution output is now limited to 10 MB by default, controlled by the `fish_read_limit` variable (#3822). Notably, this is larger than most operating systems' argument size limit, so trying to pass argument lists this size to external commands has never worked.\r\n- The machine hostname, where available, is now exposed as the `$hostname` reserved variable. This removes the dependency on the `hostname` executable (#4422).\r\n- Bare `bind` invocations in config.fish now work. The `fish_user_key_bindings` function is no longer necessary, but will still be executed if it exists (#5191).\r\n- `$fish_pid` and `$last_pid` are available as replacements for `%self` and `%last`.\r\n\r\n### New features in commands\r\n- `alias` has a new `--save` option to save the generated function immediately (#4878).\r\n- `bind` has a new `--silent` option to ignore bind requests for named keys not available under the current terminal (#4188, #4431).\r\n- `complete` has a new `--keep-order` option to show the provided or dynamically-generated argument list in the same order as specified, rather than alphabetically (#361).\r\n- `exec` prompts for confirmation if background jobs are running.\r\n- `funced` has a new `--save` option to automatically save the edited function after successfully editing (#4668).\r\n- `functions` has a new ` --handlers` option to show functions registered as event handlers (#4694).\r\n- `history search` supports globs for wildcard searching (#3136) and has a new `--reverse` option to show entries from oldest to newest (#4375)..\r\n- `jobs` has a new `--quiet` option to silence the output.\r\n- `read` has a new `--delimiter` option for splitting input into arrays (#4256).\r\n- `read` writes directly to stdout if called without arguments (#4407).\r\n- `read` can now read individual lines into separate variables without consuming the input in its entirety via the new `/--line` option.\r\n- `set` has new `--append` and `--prepend` options (#1326).\r\n- `set` has a new `--show` option to show lots of information about variables (#4265).\r\n- `string match` with an empty pattern and `--entire` in glob mode now matches everything instead of nothing (#4971).\r\n- `string split` supports a new `--no-empty` option to exclude empty strings from the result (#4779).\r\n- `string` has new subcommands `split0` and `join0` for working with NUL-delimited output.\r\n- `string` no longer stops processing text after NUL characters (#4605)\r\n- `string escape` has a new `--style regex` option for escaping strings to be matched literally in `string` regex operations.\r\n- `test` now supports floating point values in numeric comparisons.\r\n\r\n### Interactive improvements\r\n- A pipe at the end of a line now allows the job to continue on the next line (#1285).\r\n- Italics and dim support out of the box on macOS for Terminal.app and iTerm (#4436).\r\n- `cd` tab completions no longer descend into the deepest unambiguous path (#4649).\r\n- Pager navigation has been improved. Most notably, moving down now wraps around, moving up from the commandline now jumps to the last element and moving right and left now reverse each other even when wrapping around (#4680).\r\n- Typing normal characters while the completion pager is active no longer shows the search field. Instead it enters them into the command line, and ends paging (#2249).\r\n- A new input binding `pager-toggle-search` toggles the search field in the completions pager on and off. By default, this is bound to Ctrl-S.\r\n- Searching in the pager now does a full fuzzy search (#5213).\r\n- The pager will now show the full command instead of just its last line if the number of completions is large (#4702).\r\n- Abbreviations can be tab-completed (#3233).\r\n- Tildes in file names are now properly escaped in completions (#2274).\r\n- Wrapping completions (from `complete --wraps` or `function --wraps`) can now inject arguments. For example, `complete gco --wraps 'git checkout'` now works properly (#1976). The `alias` function has been updated to respect this behavior.\r\n- Path completions now support expansions, meaning expressions like `python ~/<TAB>` now provides file suggestions just like any other relative or absolute path. (This includes support for other expansions, too.)\r\n- Autosuggestions try to avoid arguments that are already present in the command line.\r\n- Notifications about crashed processes are now always shown, even in command substitutions (#4962).\r\n- The screen is no longer reset after a BEL, fixing graphical glitches (#3693).\r\n- vi-mode now supports ';' and ',' motions. This introduces new {forward,backward}-jump-till and repeat-jump{,-reverse} bind functions (#5140).\r\n- The `*y` vi-mode binding now works (#5100).\r\n- True color is now enabled in neovim by default (#2792).\r\n- Terminal size variables (`$COLUMNS`/`$LINES`) are now updated before `fish_prompt` is called, allowing the prompt to react (#904).\r\n- Multi-line prompts no longer repeat when the terminal is resized (#2320).\r\n- `xclip` support has been added to the clipboard integration (#5020).\r\n- The Alt-P keybinding paginates the last command if the command line is empty.\r\n- `$cmd_duration` is no longer reset when no command is executed (#5011).\r\n- Deleting a one-character word no longer erases the next word as well (#4747).\r\n- Token history search (Alt-Up) omits duplicate entries (#4795).\r\n- The `fish_escape_delay_ms` timeout, allowing the use of the escape key both on its own and as part of a control sequence, was applied to all control characters; this has been reduced to just the escape key.\r\n- Completing a function shows the description properly (#5206).\r\n- Added completions for\r\n  - `ansible`, including `ansible-galaxy`, `ansible-playbook` and `ansible-vault` (#4697)\r\n  - `bb-power` (#4800)\r\n  - `bd` (#4472)\r\n  - `bower`\r\n  - `clang` and `clang++` (#4174)\r\n  - `conda` (#4837)\r\n  - `configure` (for autoconf-generated files only)\r\n  - `curl`\r\n  - `doas` (#5196)\r\n  - `ebuild` (#4911)\r\n  - `emaint` (#4758)\r\n  - `eopkg` (#4600)\r\n  - `exercism` (#4495)\r\n  - `hjson`\r\n  - `hugo` (#4529)\r\n  - `j` (from autojump #4344)\r\n  - `jbake` (#4814)\r\n  - `jhipster` (#4472)\r\n  - `kitty`\r\n  - `kldload`\r\n  - `kldunload`\r\n  - `makensis` (#5242)\r\n  - `meson`\r\n  - `mkdocs` (#4906)\r\n  - `ngrok` (#4642)\r\n  - OpenBSD's `pkg_add`, `pkg_delete`, `pkg_info`, `pfctl`, `rcctl`, `signify`, and `vmctl` (#4584)\r\n  - `openocd`\r\n  - `optipng`\r\n  - `opkg` (#5168)\r\n  - `pandoc` (#2937)\r\n  - `port` (#4737)\r\n  - `powerpill` (#4800)\r\n  - `pstack` (#5135)\r\n  - `serve` (#5026)\r\n  - `ttx`\r\n  - `unzip`\r\n  - `virsh` (#5113)\r\n  - `xclip` (#5126)\r\n  - `xsv`\r\n  - `zfs` and `zpool` (#4608)\r\n- Lots of improvements to completions (especially `darcs` (#5112), `git`, `hg` and `sudo`).\r\n- Completions for `yarn` and `npm` now require the `all-the-package-names` NPM package for full functionality.\r\n- Completions for `bower` and `yarn` now require the `jq` utility for full functionality.\r\n- Improved French translations.\r\n\r\n### Other fixes and improvements\r\n- Significant performance improvements to `abbr` (#4048), setting variables (#4200, #4341), executing functions, globs (#4579), `string` reading from standard input (#4610), and slicing history (in particular, `$history[1]` for the last executed command).\r\n- Fish's internal wcwidth function has been updated to deal with newer Unicode, and the width of some characters can be configured via the `fish_ambiguous_width` (#5149) and `fish_emoji_width` (#2652) variables. Alternatively, a new build-time option INTERNAL_WCWIDTH can be used to use the system's wcwidth instead (#4816).\r\n- `functions` correctly supports `-d` as the short form of `--description`. (#5105)\r\n- `/etc/paths` is now parsed like macOS' bash `path_helper`, fixing $PATH order (#4336, #4852) on macOS.\r\n- Using a read-only variable in a `for` loop produces an error, rather than silently producing incorrect results (#4342).\r\n- The universal variables filename no longer contains the hostname or MAC address. It is now at the fixed location `.config/fish/fish_variables` (#1912).\r\n- Exported variables in the global or universal scope no longer have their exported status affected by local variables (#2611).\r\n- Major rework of terminal and job handling to eliminate bugs (#3805, #3952, #4178, #4235, #4238, #4540, #4929, #5210).\r\n- Improvements to the manual page completion generator (#2937, #4313).\r\n- `suspend --force` now works correctly (#4672).\r\n- Pressing Ctrl-C while running a script now reliably terminates fish (#5253).\r\n\r\n### For distributors and developers\r\n- fish ships with a new build system based on CMake. CMake 3.2 is the minimum required version. Although the autotools-based Makefile and the Xcode project are still shipped with this release, they will be removed in the near future. All distributors and developers are encouraged to migrate to the CMake build.\r\n- Build scripts for most platforms no longer require bash, using the standard sh instead.\r\n- The `hostname` and `bc` commands are no longer required for fish to operate.",
