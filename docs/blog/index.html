        <a href="/blog/licensing-error/">Incomplete licensing information in previous fish releases</a>
      </li>
      <p>During the work on fish 3.7.0, we discovered that the licensing
information in the documentation for some of the derived code contained in
fish had been removed during the work on fish 3.1.0, and that this was not
corrected until the release of fish 3.7.0. Although the source contained
the correct licensing information, this was not published as part of the
release’s documentation.</p>
